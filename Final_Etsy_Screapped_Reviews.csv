These are darling! I love how dainty and sparkly they are. They fit my 2nd piercing perfectly- I get worried with crawler earrings that they'll be too long. These are so cute! I'd totally buy from this seller again.,1
Absolutely stunning! I am in love with these earrings! Very fast shipping and cute packaging ‚ù§,1
"Got these once before for me and my brides maids on my wedding day! They're perfect, mine lost a jewel somewhere along the way (a year ago, and I stored them in my coin purse, not the best place for something to beautiful!), so I decided to order another set!",1
"I love how dainty and unique they are.  I got the gold and I'm glad I did.  You don't really notice the gold, but I feel it makes the stones pop.",1
"This is a really beautiful piece! I had been looking for a new crawler to put in my upper cartilage piercing, and it works perfect (once I figured out which one works best with my ear curve!) but it‚Äôs beautifully done and I really love the style of the baguettes in the earring! Love love love! And super quick shipping",1
I absolutely LOVE my earrings! They are so unique and dainty. I‚Äôve had so many compliments on them already and Connor wait to wear them for the wedding I‚Äôm in next week. I would recommend ordering from MilysDesign! My order was processed quickly and came wrapped safely in bubble wrap so the earrings wouldn‚Äôt get damaged.,1
Soooo dainty and sparkly. Can‚Äôt wait to wear them for an art-deco feel.  UPDATE: I went to bend the wire back a tad to be able to get it into my piercing hole and the whole back broke off :( hot glue won‚Äôt hold it and I‚Äôm so sad! I‚Äôll keep the one for a mix n match look but be careful because these babies are delicate!!!,0
"These are so pretty, I've gotten lots of compliments.  If I could do it over, I'd probably go with the post backs instead of the wire, but that's just personal preference.  You do beautiful work!!!",1
"Wasn't exactly flush to my ear like I was hoping from the picture, but I was able to move it a bit and adjust it so it was. It's beautiful otherwise! Fast shipping.",1
The pieces are beautiful and fitted. I plan on buying more soon,1
These are stunning! I absolutely love them! Same as picture!,1
"These earrings are beautiful! So dainty and classy. There‚Äôs just enough sparkle to wear them when you‚Äôre dressing up, but I also think you could wear them everyday. Very pleased with this purchase.",1

Absolutely stunning! I am so happy with these earrings!,1
"So pretty!! Looks gorgeous on your ear lobe :) :) the perfect amount of sparkle and twinkle. I‚Äôm in love with them üòç
Buy them you won‚Äôt regret it!",1
"Love them! They fit great and were exactly as advertised. It was my first time trying climber earrings, and I got the wire back.",1
I love how dainty and cute this is! My only wish was that the backing wasn‚Äôt a post and more of a longer ear jacket. But i love it!,1
So excited to have these on my wedding day. Wanted a little sparkle but not dangling!,1
They are beautiful!,1
I was hesitant about getting my first pair of crawlers bit glad I went for it. They're the perfect size! They also arrived super quickly,1
these are STUNNING!! i got the wire back and they stay in perfectly without needing to put the backs on,1
"Love these earrings. My first pair or ear climbers! A bit smaller than anticipated, but the perfect amount of sparkle. I've received so many compliments!",1
Parfaite. Conforme aux photos j'adore !,1
The earrings are beautiful! They‚Äôre smaller than I thought it would be. It‚Äôs dainty and pretty and I‚Äôm so excited to wear them. I was a little worried when I saw the package because it looked a little beat up but the earrings were well wrapped and protected.,1

"So glad I took a chance and ordered these beautiful earrings. I have minimalist taste, especially when it comes to jewelry. The earrings can be worn around the house in quarantine with a sweatshirt or in the event I go somewhere special again some day, they can easily compliment the dressiest of outfits. They make me feel pretty and I highly recommend them to anyone. This will be my go to shop for gifts for friends or when I want to treat myself.",1

Super cute!,1
So adorable!!!,1
Super pretty and delicate earrings.  Just 4 of 5 because they don‚Äôt always stay in place on my ears; I find them trailing off the end of my earlobes.  Which is still pretty but up to your personal preference. My experience with the shop was very positive. Quick shipping and well packaged. Will shop here again.,1
Very cute earrings. They stay in nicely (ear climbers are tricky so sometimes you do have to pinch the very end). These are a simple design that can be worn with pretty much anything!,1
These are even more beautiful in person! I love them!,1
Love them! They look so pretty and I can‚Äôt wait to show them off! I definitely want to purchase more for friends and family in the future!,1
"one of my favorite earrings i‚Äôve bought so far. i love it, it has a very classy look to it but i‚Äôd wear it everyday!",1
"I bought these adorable earrings as a birthday gift for my granddaughter. I gave her two sets and she shared the second set with me, Grammy!!  
The only thing I would have to say in regards to making them better.... they stay on your ears much more secure with a larger back on the earrings. They tend to slip down on your ear with the small earring back that they come with.
Still rate them a 5 star!!  We love  ‚Äòem!!",1
"I  really like the earrings,had a few compliments  already (very pretty)",1
Beautiful earrings!! Will buy from this shop again! ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
"The owner of this store was absolutely lovely to work with - thank you! The earrings are gorgeous, too.",1
"I'm super impressed with Lucy's professionalism and how easy she is to work with. One of my earrings arrived missing a stone, and she sent me a replacement in two days. She didn't ask me to send to flawed piece back to her either, which I appreciate (shipping fees). I'll definitely buy from her again, and would encourage my friends to buy from her too. 
I love the dainty sparkle of the earrings in my chubby ear next to my larger diamonds; they look like a trellis leading to a flower. I'm very, very happy with my purchase ‚ù£Ô∏è",1
"Love these ear climbers.
Very petite and feminine!",1
Beautiful product. I got the post back first and it didn‚Äôt sit right so seller let me return and meanwhile I purchased a wire back which fit perfectly. Very happy!,1

"They are so pretty!! Unfortunately my ears start itching when I have them on so I  guess I'm allergic to them. Also, I chose the post back and the tail of the earrings kept sliding down instead of staying up in place. I do not recommend the post back. If your ears aren't as sensitive as mine to certain earrings then I do recommend these cuz they are really pretty, its just a shame it didn't work out for me.",0

These were a lot smaller than I was expecting it they are really cute. Great quality.,1
"Super cute earrings, but more importantly I was shocked by how comfortable they are, nothing pokes into your head like the backs of normal earrings. The only issue I have is that they can definitely fall out easily so be careful if you are for some reason moving around on a bed ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1

The owner responded quickly to my message regarding the shipping delay.  So I am very happy with the purchase:)",1
Very lovey petite design. I adore them! The perfect ear decor for any occasion!,1

They are stunning I‚Äôm obsessed!,1
"So sch√∂n und mit dem tollen Opal ein richtiger Hingucker. Ich habe mir im Nachgang noch den passenden Armreif bestellt. 
Da man den B√ºgel leicht biegen kann, kann man die Halterung sch√∂n ans Ohr anpassen.",1
"It did ship on time and was very nicely wrapped and boxed! Lovely earrings...but the first time I attempted to put them in my ears, the post s broke off. Now I have to try to glue these tiny things on so that I can wear them...they obviously were not flexible , at all! Very disappointing. Especially because they were so important to me...the moon phases...and unique! :(:(",0

"Wundersch√∂ne ausgefallene Ohrstecker/-klemmen,alles bestens gelaufen",0
Lovely earrings! One thing to beware is that these funky bars do not hold very well and my mother lost one the very first time she was wearing it. Highly recommend purchasing little rubber backers to add to the bar to hold these in place.,1
Beautiful earrings.  Well made and well worth the wait due to the virus.  Thanks!,1
My daughter loves them!  Came quickly and well packaged. TY!,1

"These ear climbers are super pretty, I love the style but for some reason they hurt my ears and caused lots of irritation. I do not have sensitive skin and always clean earrings before I wear them so I‚Äôm not sure what the issue is for me. Anyway, I‚Äôve ordered the sterling silver ones of the same story and hope my ears are happier. I really like this shop, such pretty and interesting jewelry!",1

"Really nice + comfortable earrings, I love them!",1
"Beautifully and thoughtfully packaged, shipped on time; Unfortunately the earrings don't lay completely flat upwards along the ear meaning that I had to make sure to readjust ie. reposition them onto my ear. I think gently pushing down on the bracket should help keep it in place in future. 
Still a pretty and unique piece of jewelry.",1
"Great earrings - they were a gift, and she loves them! Many thanks!",1
Beautiful art worn as earrings!,1

My girlfriend loved it,1
They were exactly what I was looking for and wanted,1
"Perfect gift, she was SO thrilled.",1
Nice earrings but the mechanism that holds them along my ear lobe doesn‚Äôt always hold and they slip down.,1
"Purchased as a gift for a friend who loooved this pair, wears separately at times too",0
Earrings were poorly manufactured. Broken out of packaging. Cute concept,0
"Pretty but needed to return product to  arriving too late. Now getting frustrated trying to see if this is resolves I keep getting the ring around and people keep having.me email different folks to find out how to return these earrings,  I would not reccomend ordering from this site again if I can't get it resolved in the week ne",0
Very nice.  Received on time as well.,1
unfortunately it broke before I could use it :(,0
"The packing was nice, but one of the earrings was bent and I still wore it; however the earring fell off and I lost it the same day i received it. The earring that was bent would not stay in my ear.",0
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear",1
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D,1
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª",1
Beautiful earrings! I got many compliments.,1
"This is the third set of these I have purchased. I own a pair in gold and receive so many compliments, that I‚Äôve started gifting them to people who love them!",1
"I've left a review before, but I have started to but these quite often as everyone who sees them likes them and comments on them, so I have a load in reserve to gift people. I adore these, they're perfect. I've tried buying from other makers who may be closer, but I haven't found anyone who makes them as well.",1
"I absolutely love ear crawlers, but this is hands on the most elegant pair I‚Äôve ever bought. Outstanding quality and so delicate you‚Äôd almost forget you‚Äôre wearing them!",1
"Fair wait, light, delicate and elegant I think.",1
Beautiful. Difficult to put on ear because of the double long piece. Still love it.,1

She liked them very much.,1
The earrings never arrived. And the shop owner stoped answering back. Also the etsy costumer service was no help at all. Was the last time I ordered something here!!!,0
"Right now, I can only rate the item at one. I cannot properly review this item yet because it still hasn‚Äôt come in. I ordered it on November 19th and today is December 23rd. I will be very disappointed if it doesn‚Äôt come in time for Christmas.  I will be happy to change my review if it comes in before Christmas.",0
"I love ‚ù§Ô∏è them so much. I wear them constantly and that's saying a lot for me because I very rarely wear silver, usually only hold, but I am so happy with these earrings and hey are so cool looking that I've had to adjust my preferences! Haha. Definitely get tons of inquiries and compliments. So dainty and easy to put on and they look just wonderful. Very happy with my purchase.",1
"I debated whether to dock a star on this because I ran into a hassle actually getting them, but once they arrived I decided to give 5 stars because these earrings are really great! They are an ingenious design and exactly what I wanted. I needed earrings to wear sleeping/ to keep my holes open that would be comfortable and not fall out. They fit very securely and look great! Also, the seller puts them in a little bottle for presentation- so cool, and I can use the tiny bottle for something else. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase even though I ran into a snafu with actually getting them.",1
"I really liked my earrings. They're a bit bigger on me than on the model, but I do have small ears. They also arrived a bit on the late side, but I did order them during the holidays, and the shop owner was very attentive about the situation, so I'm still giving a five star review. Very pretty! And sturdy!",1
I am so excited to have this!  Production time and shipping was just as suspected and the item is even better in person!  The back of it is a square rather than round which allows for a more natural fit especially in my second piercing.  Thank you so much! LOVE IT!,1
perfect fit love them !,1
Love it ‚ù§,1
"This my new favorite earring, it fits perfectly and is so cute! Took about a month to get here, but I expected that with international shipping.",1
"Lost my first pieces in a move, sadly, but these were too cute and I rarely wear jewelry so I'm glad to buy a new pair! Easy to put on, I only notice a slight pressure when I move my ears, but they're very secure. I love the little maintenance note and brand design, and you can tell they're made with love. Also Ara's really nice and helpful with tracking info.",1
It took a while but I finally got it! Thank you it's really pretty! :),1
I do love this piece! I think my ears are a little too small to hold them up and in place- they tend to slip down and hang vertically. Still love them!,1
"Love it !
Thanks:)",1
"Love this jewelry! Friends like it, referring them. Now I've always got some serotonin, even if I'm not feelin it =]",1
love it!!!,1
I love these earrings!! I wear them almost everyday. This was my first purchase on etsy and I cannot be more satisfied. Thanks Arajera!!,1

Lovely them,1
"Very well packaged, and good delivery time. Note that these earrings are not great is you have thick earlobes like mine! Going to try resizing the wire for comfort.",1
"The serotonin pair of earrings are beautiful! I love wearing these on my ears. Once you figure out how to slip them on and off your ears, they are very low maintenance during the day that I almost forget I'm wearing them. It came packaged in a small jar with a care card which also make for a cute display in my jewelry area.",1
This earring is super cute and super comfortable too! Perfect for a chem nerd like me :^),1
"This seller is AWESOME! I contacted them about a delay in my delivery. She explained they'd had some issues with their delivery company and I could get a refund or have my parcel resent. I chose for resent and I'm so glad I did! 
The packaging alone is gorgeous! The earring is so cool! I know where I will be going for presents in the future!",1
"Perfect earrings, shipped in a tiny glass bottle, love them!",1
"Amazing! I love it! It fits perfectly, you can wear it all day, without any discomfort.",1
"Perfecto, es tal como aparece en la web.",1
"I LOVE THESE! I go them way before I expected them! I was worried about them not fitting but they fit perfectly! They are well made and exactly what i was hoping for! I also loved the vial that it came in, it was a very nice touch!",1
"So nice, comes in the prettiest package",1
I adore this item. It fits really well and it's made of high quality materials. And it arrived earlier than I expected. I've already placed another order for more!,1
"Great quality, was shipped exactly on time, love it!",1
"It looks deceptively small when you pull it out of its package but is in fact rather large on your ear- a good thing, because it can easily be seen. Fits nicely if you have multiple piercings too, I have three and it fits nicely behind the other two.",1
"These earrings are great, and the design is pretty creative. They were shipped in a glass bottle with a cork. I think this is ingenious and much better than a box most people use.",1
I have bought THREE pairs over the last few years because I‚Äôm always losing things. But I love them that much! ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
"I put the wrong US zip code in and thought package was sent to a different address. Ara was responsive and helpful when I contacted her (turns out it was sent to the right address) Lovely earrings, makes for a great gift!",0

"Lovely unique looking earring, gets lots of admiring glances. Lovely helpful seller & arrived really quickly for reasonably priced postage :)",1
Absolutely love these!!! Thank you!!,1
Very cute!,1
This item is adorable and comes with care instructions.  I'm not a fan of shippers that make you sign for packages as I work all week. And the post office in my area is crazy nuts all the time. It took forever to get my order because I had to be home to get it. Inconvenient! Cute product,0
"What a fun idea, making earrings of different molecules! I love ear climbers as I can't wear dangling earrings for work so these are perfect. This is the third pair I ordered. Ara does the best work. I'm sure I will order again.",1
These are so amazing!! I haven't worn earrings for years & these are just so original & simple & beautiful. Thank you!,1
"Beautiful, elegant and delicate. I love both of these ear climbers. Excellent quality !",1
"Love this and everything I've ordered from this seller! Products came with free anti-tarnishing polishing cloth and in small glass jars to protect from tarnish. Even when Etsy sent this to my wrong old address, Ara made the effort to contact the shippers and get it sent to my right address. Wonderful experience, will be buying from this store again!",0
It fits and hugs my ear perfectly,1
"Classy and unconventional earrings, great stuff !
The packaging is lovely !",1
"Je trouve cette boucle tr√®s belle ! 
Discret et √©l√©gant, c'est vraiment beau.",1
"This looks great on, although it is slightly big for my ear so be careful if you have smaller ears.",1
"My ear lobes are a little small for these earrings, they stick out a bit underneath. But still look great!",1
Unique earrings and lovely packaging. Thank you so much! :),1
I love it! It makes me feel fashionable and feminine!,1
"Really nice quality! Arrived a little later than expected, but they traveled a long way‚ùóÔ∏èpackaged in a little bottle with care explanation. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"The shipping took longer than expected (over a month), but the product and packaging were gorgeous and my mom was really pleased with this gift!",1
Definitely so worth the wait!,1
"They're so cute, the only issue is the end of the bar (that goes behind the ear) pokes me. But I had some wax balls lying around the house and it was an easy fix!",1
Seller is very accommodating. Good quality and quick delivery. Thanks so much!,1
"These are so fun!  My college freshman daughter chose these in lieu of getting more holes in her ears, for now at least!  Well made, good fit, arrived fairly fast!",1
"I love it, even though I have freakishly small ears they almost fit perfectly, the bottom is just a little too big",1
"Nice feedback quick service friendly
Nice tips for silver
Look amazing 
Can't wait to give it to my daughter",1
The item I ordered was good quality and I was happy with it! However the earring I ordered was a little big for my earlobe. Other than that I was pleased with what I ordered.,1

"They're cute! Bigger than you'd think, and took a long time to ship (ordered May 10, shipping process started May 24, and received June 7), but I dig 'em. It really struggles to stay in the correct orientation though. It falls over unless I make it really tight (much tighter than the dopamine I also have), which kinda makes my ear bright red and hot, but price of happiness ammirite?",1
Very beautifully made and it is very sturdy and of high quality. the only thing i would complain about is that my earlobes are too small to fit the whole thing >:,1
The item is perfect! Thank you so much :),1
"Super cute earrings and shipping was speedy
Great transaction. Thank you!",1
These are so cute!  Great gift!,1

It's really comfortable and matches the description and picture.,1
"This item was exactly as described and arrived in a timely fashion.  However, I ordered a second ear cuff and was anticipating giving it as a Christmas gift to my best friend.  The shop failed to ship the second cuff, despite ordering it before their Christmas cutoff, and left me scrambling days before to find a suitable replacement gift.",1
Exactly as described. Lovely piece of jewellery.,1
it is a very cute cuff,1
"These are beautiful and nerdy. They tend to slide off my ear a bit, but I don't think they ever risk falling out.",1
Great item! Thanks so much!,1

"Looks exactly as I expected, however the metal bar that goes through the ear was too large for my ear piercings. It was painful trying to get them in. I haven't had this issue with other earrings.",0
My ear-climbers just arrived! They are the nicest earrings I've ever owned and I couldn't be happier with them! The quality is amazing üòä,1
Sehr sch√∂ne Ohrringe! Sehen sehr edel aus. Lieferung dauerte da. 4 Wochen.,1

Great pair of earrings! sleek and minimalist and just what I wanted. I'm wearing them right now!,1
Love this ear climber. I‚Äôve ordered others where the post that goes behind the ear wasn‚Äôt as robust and after repeated wearing the post would break off from tightening and loosening. This one seems like it‚Äôll hold up much better.,1
Perfect fit and adds some edge,1
Love them. Smooth elegance. The fit is comfortable and it stays in place.,1

Very thin! Just as I expected. If you‚Äôve ever worn an earring like this you may have to adjust the width to keep it secure and I can do that with this earring with out fear of it snapping or losing its proper shape.,1
"Shipping kinda took a while, which I expected but they are great! They sometimes catch on my hair and slip off my ear but they‚Äôre so easy to slide back into place.",1

Great little ear-pins. Love 'em!,1

"These are so cute, just what I wanted!",1
Beautiful earrings! I love them!,1
"Cute 
Great for young girls",1
"Shipped within a day and took a week to get to me which is pretty good for times like these. The earrings are so pretty and seem strong even though they look delicate. The only thing is, my ears are super sensitive and usually handle .925 sterling silver with no problem but these agitated my ears. I'd recommend buying these ear crawlers if you have sturdy ears but maybe shop elsewhere if you're prone to irritation.",1
I really want to give it a five but they keep falling down my earrings and the silver have chipped and I really really really love them. I'm just so disappointed with what happened to them. But I still love them and this has been my experience.,1
Good quality and good price. Will be back for more!,1

Exactly like the photo! And very comfortable! Definitely would recommend,1
"It‚Äôs so cute..in theory. In practicality it ended up not fully formed out of the mold, one stud was jagged and snagged when trying to put into my ear. The stars aren‚Äôt as precisely cut, and I ended up taking a file to smooth out the edges & stud. They also don‚Äôt really stay in position, needing to be adjusted often. Again, really cute, so I‚Äôm working with them, but not as I was expecting.",0

"Product took longer to ship than it should have, but it was out of the seller‚Äôs control due to Covid stuff. Seller was transparent and gave me the option to cancel the order,  which I declined because the earrings were exactly what I wanted. The seller shipped them out as soon as possible and they were received just a few days after Christmas. The seller went above and beyond to accommodate, even though the supply issues were out of her control. Would definitely buy from them again.",0

"This is so pretty but it‚Äôs VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I‚Äôm hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don‚Äôt know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it‚Äôs PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!",1

Despite being based in Spain, they shipped quickly and arrived within a week!",1
"These are beautiful earrings that give just enough interest to an outfit. I love wearing them with just regular tees or with casual dresses. I got them in gold and they perfectly complement my boyish pixie cut. 

Lalia quickly shipped my purchase the day after I ordered them, but because she's based in Spain, it took about a week and a half to get to the U.S. (just to give you a heads up). The earrings are well worth the wait though, I promise!!",1
"They‚Äôre cute. However they are completely uneven, and do not fit each ear even remotely evenly. Also if you have sensitive skin beware, this material will give you complications if you have metal sensitivies. They also fall out a lot. But at least they‚Äôre cute!",0
Love these earrings.  They are beautifully made and the ability to adjust them is genius to achieve the perfect fit.  This was my first purchase from this seller and I am so happy to have found this lovely shop!,1

"These are just great, really original looking. Speedy shipping. Only downside is that they're fiddly as hell to put on, but that's not a flaw in these earrings, just what you get with this style! Would definitely purchase from here again.",1
Totally in love with the jewelry + fast delivery!,1

"The wait was worth it! Blown away by the quality, Bylia! 100% will buy again.",1
"I bought this gift for my petite niece's 40th birthday. Before receiving them I was a little nervous about how well they would fit but there are three holes at the back of the earring which allow for some adjustment and this was not a problem. They arrived with me, in the U.K., from Spain, in 4 working days which was great. My niece was delighted to have such an usual pair of earrings. I thought them elegant, well made, high quality and, finally, nicely presented and I would recommend this item. I couldn't have asked for more, many thanks. Tina",1

"Beautiful and dainty spiked ear jacket, just as pictured. I appreciate the gold plating which prevents allergic reaction with base metals. I looked elsewhere for the same design, but this was the best price by far. Thank you!",1
They arrived really quickly and I just love them. It's good that they're adjustable and you can wear it as an ear jacket or just the stud on its own. So pretty,1

"Super cute & appears to be good quality. Since I live in the U.S., I did not get updated shipping information once the product left Spain, so there was a gap of >2 weeks when I got no updated tracking information, but the shop owner was very responsive, & I did receive the product as promised. Would buy again!",0

I haven‚Äôt gotten this item in the mail yet it‚Äôs been almost a month,1
"This seemed to take a long time to arrive, but it did arrive toward the end of the time frame given. The clasp of one earring did not stay on and the 3 pieces fell apart easily. After several communications and sending requested pictures of the earring, the seller did identify the problem and outline a way for me to fix it. Seller always replied to my comments within 1 business day. However, it was frustrating to have to go through a ""fix it"" process at all.",0
They are SO cute! I got my husband‚Äôs initials and they are so well made and I am beyond happy with my purchase! üíó,1
I absolutely love my earrings!  I love that my twinkies‚Äô first name initials will always be with me üíô‚ù§Ô∏è,1

"Just received these and I have to say they're really nice. BUT, with that being said, the part that goes through the ear hole is very flimsy. Tried to put the backing through for the first time and it bent already. Not sure if it will hold up. Wish it was made of stronger material.",0

"Super cute, great gift idea",1
Item was exactly what I was looking for. Shipped quickly.,1
"I LOVE this ear cuff. üòç It is absolutely stunning and easily the most beautiful piece of jewelry I own. Plus, the sizing and dimensions were just right for my ear. There‚Äôs a post for pierced ears on the bottom and a wrap around clamp for the cartilage on top. I wore this as a part of a ‚Äúqueen‚Äù costume at an event where I was dancing all night and the cuff stayed on really well... which is saying a lot cause I really move my head around when I dance. It did get a bit painful on the top, especially when it got brushed while hugging people, but the clamp is adjustable, so loosening it did help a bit. It‚Äôs so beautiful, though, that it was worth any discomfort. Also, I paid for 1-3 day shipping and it did take a week to come to the States, so just be sure to plan accordingly. It‚Äôs worth the wait!",1
"Absolutely LOVE the cuff. It fits perfectly and stays in place. Customs were rediculously expensive though, but it's still a really beautiful ear accessory!",1
"Vraiment d√©√ßue et choqu√©e par la qualit√© du produit √©tant donn√© son prix. 
Sans oublier que le facteur √† ma porte m‚Äôa factur√© 47‚Ç¨ de ‚Äúfrais de douane‚Äù alors qu‚Äôils ne sont mentionn√©s nulle part dans l‚Äôannonce!!!
Attention, ne vous faites pas avoir!!!!",1
Beautiful craftsmanship! Simple and elegant. I‚Äôm very happy with this piece!,1
Absolutely gorgeous earrings. I love that there's an adjustable clasp at the top portion to keep the earrings in place! The only drawback is that they took a little less than a month to arrive (overseas shipping).,1
Very beautiful ear climber and matching stud. Fantastic quality. Would absolutely buy again.,1
So beautiful.. üòç..I will rate the seller 10/10..A+++,1
Love them! The perfect pretty show stoppers for my sister's wedding.,1
I am so happy with these earrings. I‚Äôll be wearing these on my wedding day and can‚Äôt wait to show them off! Thank you!,1
Love these earrings!  Will add some unique sparkle to different outfits.,1
En attente de commande! C‚Äôest un scandale,0
Very beautiful piece. I‚Äôm very excited to wear it in Palm Springs!,1
"I ordered these in rose gold and then messaged the shop on the same day of purchase to see if I could actually request the same ones in silver instead. The shop owner confirmed that this was possible and asked me to provide a link to the color I wanted, which I did.

I ordered them at the end of December for an event on February 1st. They just arrived and they‚Äôre beautiful but they‚Äôre rose gold instead of silver. Because the shipping took so long, I won‚Äôt be able to have this corrected in time for my event. My fault for changing the color but I am bummed that the shop owner wasn‚Äôt able to make the correction after confirming.",0
"Thank You for changing my order for me , I really appreciate it. The ear crawlers are really pretty!",1
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.",1
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!,1
"This ring looks so amazing! I‚Äôve never seen a prettier ring, and my now fianc√©e absolutely loves it! The picture doesn‚Äôt do it justice. It looks so much better in person. I could not be happier about my purchase.",1
"Words can‚Äôt even describe how impressed I was! At first I was skeptical ordering a ring without seeing it in person. However I‚Äôm so glad I did! Lena was amazing throughout the whole process! My boyfriend and I picked out this ring together as my engagement ring, but has not yet proposed, so waiting to officially wear it! Highly recommend this shop! They were very flexible with payments and doing custom sizing. Couldn‚Äôt have had a better experience!",1
"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù",1
"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!",1
"From the fianc√©:
 
I found Lena on Etsy several years ago while browsing for jewelry, and instantly fell in love with her beautiful rings. Even before dating my now-fianc√©, I dreamily ‚Äúfavorited‚Äù this emerald engagement ring, thinking that someday I‚Äôd be engaged to the love of my life with this ring on my finger. I can‚Äôt believe that day has finally come! It is even more beautiful in-person and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with Lena‚Äôs craftsmanship! Most importantly, the ring has special significance to me knowing that it was handmade in Israel where I was born, spent the first five years of my life, and still visit to see family. Thank you, Lena, for being a part of this memorable time in our lives!",1
"I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my rings! Lena worked so hard to make sure my wedding band fit perfectly with my engagement ring - and was extremely prompt and easy to communicate with. She is so genuinely kind and went above and beyond in ensuring that I was completely thrilled with my rings. Our wedding day was perfection!! Lena is creative, sweet, and thoughtful! I love my rings!",1
"Lena from sevencaratshop was incredibly helpful in helping me acquire this ring for my now fianc√©e. All of her jewelry looks great and is easy to find on her Etsy page. She had it sized and shipped halfway across the world in minimal time, I was able to propose much earlier than anticipated. The quality of the diamond is pristine, such an exquisite cut I even find myself taking closer looks at it! Of course she said yes, and now the only thing shining brighter than the ring is my gorgeous fianc√©es smile. She loves showing it off and it‚Äôs all thanks to Lena at sevencaratshop! I will be a repeat customer in the future for sure!",1
"The whole process of selecting a ring, custom designing it, delivering etc. has been amazing with Lena. The ring itself is stunning and I could not be happier with it. My partner is in love with it, she thinks that it is the perfect ring. She has compliments everywhere we go.
I cannot speak highly enough of Lena's customer service, despite being nervous about ordering online I felt I had better customer service than buying from a shop. I would 100% to recommend SevenCaratShop to anyone looking for beautiful unique jewelry. 
Thank you Lena, you have been amazing!",1
"I received my diamond ring and I was absolutely delighted with the quality and workmanship! I tried to capture its brilliance in the photo, the diamond is stunning! I am very pleased, and so is my husband! I will not hesitate to purchase again from Lena!",1
Lena is great to work with! She created a custom order so I could have a wedding ring that fit perfectly with my engagement ring!,1
"From the fianc√©e- It's absolutely gorgeous! It took about two weeks to ship, and then it arrived within 4 days. It fits perfectly and the stones are exactly what I wanted. My fianc√© proposed at the zoo, and the polar bear came up to admire the ring immediately. We also got some wonderful photos of the sea lions swimming by to take a peek! I'm so happy with this ring, I can't stop staring at it and I'm so happy we went with Lena! Thank you for creating such a beautiful engagement ring that I'll wear and cherish forever!",1
"Absolutely beautiful ring! I was very apprehensive about buying without seeing but Lena was very communicative and I‚Äôd read all the reviews beforehand. It‚Äôs so stunning! The halo ring means a lot to me as I sadly lost my Dad in May and I wanted something beautiful to look at every day that reminds me of my lovely,  shining star. Thank you Lena x",1
Absolutely beautiful ring! Can‚Äôt stop staring at it and constantly get compliments on it. Would Never go to another jeweler. She takes excellent care with my jewelry and goes out of her way to make sure it‚Äôs perfect!,1
"I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the custom set that Lena built for me! Pictures don‚Äôt do it justice, it is so beautiful and I couldn‚Äôt be more in love with it! Lena was amazing to work with and made the process of purchasing something so important and an international purchase a little less intimidating. She really did everything she could to ease any anxiety about such a big purchase that I was never able to see in person until it arrived. Thank you so much!",1
"Really nice piece. Fast shipment. Very nice people to do business with. Lena really went above and beyond my expectations of customer service. 

Only thing, I wish I would have realized the size. It appears larger than it is in the photo, but my mistake, as the size is listed in the description. I have attached a photo. Wish I had a better photo to send, but I'm behind on posting a review as I received this more than a months ago. The chain in the photo is my own. It was not purchased with the pendant. 

Moving forward, I can overlook the size, as it really is a beautiful piece that attracts a lot of compliments. Thank you Lena for your awesome customer service!!  üëåüèºüòò",1
I just received my rings! I was pretty nervous ordering such a high dollar item on the internet but I will buy all of my jewelry from Lena at SevenCarat! The rings are absolutely stunning and everything I had hoped!,1
"Lena made a beautiful ring! It is exactly what I hoped. Everyone thinks it's quite beautiful and elegant. The experience of her helping design it was quite easy, and I got exactly what I wanted! Thanks!",1
I love this ring and so does my Fianc√©. The fact it is hand made and the diamonds are not conflict stones really appealed to me. The design looks really elegant. The customer service was outstanding. They even allowed me to make payments on the ring. They're awesome thank you guys,1
"She said YES to her dream ring! She loves it, thank you!!",1
Beautiful pair of diamond earrings.  I love them.  Thank you so much ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,1
"I can,t speak highly enough of Lena,s personal level of service and communication. Absolutely beautiful earrings, couldn,t be happier!",1
"So impressed with this ring, and most importantly, so was my (now) fiance! The ring absolutely stuns, totally sparkles in the light. The small diamonds are perfect, as is the main diamond.

Diamond has no visible inclusions, and the price was such a tremendous value.

Lena contacted me within hours of setting up the order, got the ring in roughly 10 days which was fantastic!

Could not be happier, thank you so much!",1
I got this as a gift to myself and I absolutely love it! I get compliments all the time. I'm not a good enough photographer to show how beautiful this is. If I ever want to splurge on me again I know where to go.,1
Love the detailing. Don't care for how they sit in the ear. Delivery was great.,1
"I was immensely impressed with Lena's craftsmanship. The ring was exactly what I wanted. 

I was having so much trouble finding something that met my budget and also spoke to me. 

I even had a crazy delivery deadline and Lena did everything in her power to get my order all the way to Canada in time for my flight to San Francisco to ask my girlfriend to marry to me. 

(She said yes, by the way).

Blown away by Lena's customer service and artistry. Could not have asked for more.

Thank you so very much.

-Carolyn from Canada :)",0
"Its more beautiful in reality than the picture, can't be more happier with service and the product, my wife felt like queen today, I awfully thank you.",1
"After much searching, my fianc√©e and I were glad to find Lena's Sevencaratshop. Lena's designs are beautiful, elegant and timeless. 

Lena went to considerable lengths to make sure my fianc√©e was happy with the gold diamond engagement ring I purchased, demonstrating great care not only in her craftsmanship but also for her customer's satisfaction. 

Thanks, Lena, for helping to make our engagement a pleasant one. We greatly appreciate you and your work!",1
Love my ring! Lena was so easy to work with and had great communication. Highly recommended!,1
"The garnet stud earrings set in 14K white gold were gorgeous! The stones were superior quality, very deeply colored and clear. The goldwork was truly professional.
The gift box was beautiful and so was the luxe gift bag.
Delivery was swift, and secure (I had to sign for the package). 
I loved the idea that these earrings were handmade and not mass produced. That made them extra special.
Most of all, my daughter LOVED them!
I would recommend Lena at SevenKarat without hesitation.
Thank you very much, Lena! üíñüíñüíñ",1
First I was uncertain to order a diamond ring online. I was scared to get scammed. But now Im so glad to trusted Lena. The ring is even more beautiful life. Lena was always answering me fast. I can remmonded everyone who isn¬¥t sure to buy a ring online. And the price/performance ratio is great. Thank you so much Lena!!!,1
"Very fast shipping considering the ring came from Israel. I liked that the seller used Fedex vs the postal service.

The ring is gorgeous! It has incredible sparkle! It is difficult to believe this ring is just 1 carat as it looks like a 3 carat ring. I also like that the band of the ring gets slightly wider in the back. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase! I‚Äôm wearing it as an anniversary ring.",1
"After reviewing the various engagement rings available on Etsy, I stumbled across Lena's 1 ct diamond engagement ring with my partner (now fianc√©e) and we both instantly impressed at how beautiful it looked after reading the description and viewing the photos available online!  After contacting Lena for guidance on how to arrange a payment plan, she responded back straight away and was an absolute pleasure to deal with the whole way through the process right up until the ring was shipped out to me in Australia and arrived safely and securely in an extremely quick turnaround of 3 business days. I was absolutely thrilled with the ring when it arrived, it truly does look amazing, and due to the excellent service I received from Lena, my fianc√©e has now decided to purchase my engagement ring online from Sevencaratshop too!",1
Lena was a pleasure to work with and the rings are simply stunning. The design is so unique and intricate. Thank you so much for my fianc√©‚Äôs dream ring!,1

Thank you Lena!",1
"We bought these for my mom for Christmas. She LOVES them. Everyone compliments how beautiful and delicate they look. However, they are not delicate at all. They are well made and lock into place when the backing is on correctly. She loves that they are handmade from Israel. Lena got them to us quickly. I am so pleased with them and this shop will be an Etsy favorite now.",1

Thank you so much! This is a beautiful ring - I love it! It looks better in person than I expected from the photos. Fast delivery and lovely packing. I‚Äôm very happy!,1
"Lena was awesome to deal with. The ring is very sparkly and the carat weight was actually a bit higher than expected. 

It was slightly cloudier than expected which is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. 

Everyone has been a huge fan of it, though! Very happy with my purchase and my new wife loves it. It's a very cool looking ring, that is absurdly sparkly in the light.",1

I love my new ear climbers.  They are beautiful.  And the way they were packaged made them even more special!  You have definitely won my business.  üíô,1
These are beautiful and versatile. I have received a lot of complements and the stones have a more pronounced effect than just metal earrings. One of the earring tip was sharp and I contacted the seller who was gracious and swift to replace the earring. It is a little difficult putting in because my piercing is small. I recommend the rubber backs which help them to secure in place. I wear them as climbers and also down.,1
"So gorgeous!!! Feminine and sparkly!!!    The photo does not do it justice - Just lovely!!!
 I have bought things before - and I am never disappointed!!!   Even the detail in the wrapping - that is a gift in itself!!! Thank you so much!!!!",1

I love these!! They will be perfect for my wedding. They are made well and good quality and fit great. I don't think they'll slide down.,1
Very pretty earrings. I was a bit skeptical about how they would fit because my ears are very small and I have tunnels in my first hole i put them in my third hole and they are perfect. Nice and dainty!,1
Ordered both the rose and white gold! Beaustifully pacakaged üòç Looks even better in person!! Great ear crawlers; shiny!!,1
The earrings I bought looked exactly like the picture and are beautiful! Seller was quick to answer my question and I got my order quick!,1

Love the earrings! Bought 10 pairs for my bridesmaids.  Now I wish I would have purchased a pair for myself as well!,1
These are perfect! I can't wait to wear for my wedding and even better that they're hypoallergenic.,1
Bit pricey for what I received. But overall happy,1

"Beautiful earrings. Although the earrings are as expected and pretty, unfortunately, they won't stay up so they keep dangling down. Guess my ear shape just isn't made for earring cuffs/crawlers. Beautiful just not for me.",1
Bought a pair for myself and had to go back and buy a pair for my friend. Lovely earrings.,1
Beautiful but unfortunately the first time I wore them I lost one within an hour :-(,0
"Shipping on time. Cute packaging. Nothing really special about the item. The part that bugged me was that it moved a lot on my ear.. it is a little pliable so you can form it around your ear lobe, but it never stays. At the end of the day, it just ends up dangling vertically off of my ear.",1
They are pretty junky & cheap looking.  Not even going waste the postage to send them back.,0
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!",1
"These are beautiful, quality, and hand crafted. I love them. They are stunning and unique. Very excited for my wedding day. My only recommendation for the shop owner is to post a photo of the back of the earring. I did not realize it had a stud and a clip on section (makes sense given its design; very practical!). I also like that I can adjust the strength of the clip on part. They are a bit heavier than you might expect, so if you have sensitive ears, you might want to go a bit smaller.",1
"These were purchased for my wedding day and were absolutely everything I dreamed of. Beautiful earrings, high quality, photographed incredibly. Thank you!",1
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.,1
"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again.",1
Yasss. I love them. So cute. Packaging adorable!,1
I was so happy with the pieces I bought and got so many compliments throughout my wedding! Great communication with shop owner and worked with me to expedite my order so I had it for my wedding day!!,1
Absolutely gorgeous. She is so helpful and sent me earrings with boxes and bags. These are even more beautiful in person since she uses really great quality stones,1
Amazing amazing earrings! Got them for my wedding and got so many compliments! Different from anything I saw at any other store and super easy to wear.,1
"I love these earrings! They are gorgeous and unique and sooo sparkly! They fit perfectly, I can‚Äôt wait to wear them on my wedding day! These earrings have the clamp on the back for the upper part of the earlobe so if your ears are small or not shaped right these might not fit great. Fast shipping and they were exactly as described. Thank you Iloniti!",1
Absolutely loved my earrings!  Shop owner helped me to pick out a pair that would fit my dress and look best.  Sent in a timely manor and wrapped in a beautiful little box.  Totally recommend!!,1
"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!",1
"I looked for weeks for the perfect set of earrings for my wedding day and stumbled upon these, they were absolutely perfect and I still love wearing them for other special occasions. I feel like they looked great in all the pictures, they are gorgeous! I bought a matching necklace for my maid of honor as well.",1
Gorgeous earrings just like the photos provided ! Shipping was super speedy and can't wait to wear these sparkly beauty's for my wedding day !,1
I absolutely love these. They are even more stunning in person and perfect to complete my wedding day look!,1
"These earrings made it to corsica and impressed everyone! Gorgeous elegant but discrete, they were just perfect! Great customer service on top!",1
"I purchased these earrings for my wedding in the Fall and they are beautiful, although I felt like they were too big for my earlobes and didn't fit as well as I would like. I expressed this to the owner and she offered to send me another pair of my choice at no cost. I can tell that she really cares about her customers. I found a new pair of earrings and am so excited to wear them for my wedding!",1

"Great communication and great quality, looked absolutely beautiful on my wedding day.",1
I ordered these earrings and received them within a week! The packaging was to die for and the quality of the earrings is phenomenal. I cannot wait to wear them on my wedding day in December!,0
"These earings are beautiful! I love the way they give a sparkle covering your earlobe. They are for pierced ears but have an extra attachment similar to clip ones earings. It secures the earring to the edge of the ear to keep them in place.  Comfortable and BEAUTIFUL!
Great customer service as I exchanged them for white gold to match my wedding dress!",1
These earrings are beautiful!! Perfect for my wedding day!!,1
I can't express my love for these earrings and this shop enough! Iloniti was an amazing communicator and these earrings are perfect and so so so beautiful!,1
"Gorgeous! They are small and simple, yet eye catching and so elegant. They look just like they do in the picture. Came wrapped perfectly.",1
"Quick shipping, great customer service, earrings were beautiful and as expected. The part that clips the top to your ear lobe is adjustable - if it's too tight it pulls back and looks weird, but if it's too loose it will drop down while you're wearing them, it took me a little bit to get them adjusted perfectly, but after that they stayed up, looked beautiful, and were not uncomfortable at all! :-)",1
Gorgeous! The seller was gracious to create my vision by adding a few white opals into the design. i would definitely purchase from this shop again.,1
"Shipped very quickly, high quality.  Excellent packaging.  Even came with extra backs for the earrings which is great because I'm always losing the backs!  I'm so excited to wear these on my wedding day, thank you!",1
"These are great!  Exactly like the photos!  I do wish there had been a picture of the back of the earrings.  What you don't know is there is a twist clasp (probably not the right term for it) at the very top and I assume this is to help keep the earrings on up top b/c they are quite heavy but I've been struggling to twist that on and to get them on properly.  However, I'm not too worried about it and I'm sure it'll work out on the wedding day.  :)",0
Love the way it looks with my engagement ring!,1
I bought these earrings for my wedding! I love the way the crystals are arranged. They have a beautiful sparkle to them! I have multiple piercings on my earlobes - but this earring covers up the rest of the holes! They have an adjustable screw that helps keep the earring on your ear without pinching it! Can‚Äôt wait to show them off!,1
This picture doesn‚Äôt do these gorgeous earrings justice. I have a small earlobe so I appreciate the added clasp that is adjustable. Packaging and delivery beyond my expectations. Overall exceptional experience. I will definitely buy from her again.,1
These earrings are gorgeous!  They are high-quality and have a small adjustable clamp to hold the climbers to your ear without worrying about them moving at all.  Love love love!,1
These are so beauttiful and they were delivered very fast to Vancouver Canada. Can't wait to wear them on my wedding day,1
"Love these earrings! They're beautiful and fit well. Really fun, and the perfect complement to my simple wedding gown.",1
Got these for my wedding.  I love them.  They catch the light and shine so beautifully!,1
Perfect! Add opals to match my wedding sash.,1
Ces boucles sont tout simplement superbes ! Je ne regrette pas du tout cet achat. L'emballage √©tait vraiment tr√®s soign√©. Tout √©tait vraiment PARFAIT !,0
"Excellent quality, very well constructed. The earring has a post and earring back like most earrings then has a clamp that clamps onto the middle of your ear to achieve the 'crawler' look. I wasn't sure when I ordered how this was going to work and I was very pleased with how it was put together. Can't wait to wear these for our wedding!",1
"These are even more beautiful in person üòç Can't wait to wear them on my wedding day!! Will definitely be ordering more, Thank you!",1
"Absolutely stunning and much lighter than I was expecting which is fantastic. Great quality, seems nice and sturdy. Sparkly, glamorous and nicely packaged. My only concern (and this would be a personal preference which is why I'm keeping it at 5 stars) is the clasp for the upper part of the earring that climbs, I think wearing them for long periods of time may cause discomfort to some.",1
"Package, timing and delivery was absolutely amazing!! The earring are even better & exactly what I wanted. Thank you so much for being amazing!!!",1
Amazing jewellery!!!!!,1
Really beautiful and unique! They don't sit as flush to the ear as in the picture but I was already expecting that from past reviews. Planning on just using a little bit of facial glue to have them sit the way I want. Can't wait to wear them for my wedding! Thank you!,1
I would absolutely order from the owner of the shop again and again! She was unbelievably sweet and with outstanding costumer service. The wrong earrings were accidentally put into my order and she fixed it before I even got the package. Beautiful jewelry and I seriously can't wait to wear it for my wedding day!,1
Absolutely beautiful! I was so surprised at how much more beautiful it was in person. It arrived very quick and I could not be more excited to have purchased this for my wedding.,1
Omg! I absolutely LOVE my new earrings! I cannot wait to wear them for my wedding ‚ù§Ô∏è,1

Gorgeous! Better than expected! I am so excited to wear them on my wedding day.,1
gorgeous!!,1
"The earrings are beautiful and are exactly how they are pictured on here!  I might need to get different backs, as you can see the backs because my ears are so small.

Pretty earrings. Sit a bit further back on my earlobe than the picture displayed. The cuff has a screw attachment to secure to upper ear which can be seen from the back. Pricey for what your receive.,0
"I bought these earrings for my wedding and I absolutely LOVED them. They look and feel high quality, and they looked beautiful at the wedding. 

My only small issue was that the clasp on the upper part of the earring was not angled in a way that easily fit my ears. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just my ear shape, but I had to have help getting the earrings on. However, they did still fit, they stayed on all day, they looked beautiful, and I wouldn‚Äôt change earrings if I had the chance! And to be fair to the shop, I didn‚Äôt try these on ahead of time (my fault) so I did not get the chance to discuss this with the shop or get it corrected.",0

The seller was so kind and quick to respond when I had a question about the shipping. She helped to track my package which I sincerely appreciated. The earrings only arrived 2 days outside of the estimated delivery window which she warned me from the start may happen due to world-wide COVID-19 delays. Overall very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend.",1

I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!",1

MAL REMATADO, SE VE DE MUY MALA CALIDAD, Y NI ME LO PUEDO PONER PORQUE EL PALO ES MAS CORTO DE LO NORMAL Y NO LLEGA PARA PONER LA TUERCA.
MI EXPERIENCIA UN 0.",0
"I really like these, but they're a little big and don't sit straight.",1
Muy bonitos. Quedan bien en cualquier oreja. Bien dise√±ados,1
Unique and gorgeous design.,1
They arrived today and are beautiful!  Thank you so much! I look forward to wearing them. :),1
So cute and exactly as pictured! Goes with so many different looks and I've already had someone ask where I got them!,1
Item just as described & even more beautiful in person,1
"The small triangles are so thin and small that they barely show up. Maybe a raised surface might help. I think these would be great in gold or a (the adjective escapes me now) shiny silver. I don't think that, for me, the flat/brushed silver is good. Will give as a gift.",1
Tr√®s sympa comme style et qualit√© plut√¥t bonne.,1
"They feel a little heavy on my ears, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get used to it the more I wear them. Other than that, I like them.",1
"Very pretty, very comfortable, and perfectly unique. True to picture.",1
The back triangle is a little bigger than I expected (but I also have very small earlobes). Definitely well made.,1

Got these as a christmas present for a friend and she loved them! Very cute in person!,1
"Lovely, unique design.  Thank you!",1
"The earrings are a bit sharp, and they're difficult to put on because the hole in the backing of the large triangle is tiny (so that they don't budge when the smaller stud goes through). I also think if the earrings were slightly thicker they'd probably be more comfortable. However, they do look really cool once they're in your ears.",1
These were a gift for my sister. She really likes them. They are very pretty and nice quality.,1
I really do love these ear jackets. They look exactly as pictured but just a little sharp around the edges. This probably wouldn't be a problem for most but my two year old finds a way to hit them perfectly to pin the points into my neck.,1
"Minimalist design, much larger than expected and therefore I am unable to wear them. The design is great however.",1
"The earrings are cute and delivery was very fast.   The back triangle is not attached to the earring back, so it can be a little tricky to get on.",0
Too big for my small ears. But really beautiful. Not made with very strong material.,0
it was much bigger than expected,0
I only wear the small triangle front. My earlobes are too big to see the back one.,0
The jewelry looked cheap and it shouldn't when paying $40. The brass looked bent and used . I bought them as a gift for Xmas and I'm embarrassed .,0
Funky and cool looking earrings. Although the actual material is darker than in the picture.,0
"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her.",1

Beautiful craftmanship!  Shipment arrived safe.,1
"LOVE these earrings! This is the first pair of ear climbers I‚Äôve ever owned, and they‚Äôre lovely. I ordered the pearly white color and they came just as pictured. I was concerned they would look odd with my second piercings, but the earring covers them up beautify. The left earring fit perfectly but the right one was a little too curved for my ear shape, so I had to bend it a little bit but now it looks just as good as the left one. They stay in place really well unless they get caught on something (like a hair brush). The gold accent bead makes them even more unique and I love the extra flair that it gives. I‚Äôm very pleased with my purchase. Would definitely recommend!",1
"I sadly just discovered the sorcery that IS the ‚Äúear climber,‚Äù and now I am simply doomed. These are so cute, so simple and so classic, and I am going to be the talk of the town when I flaunt these tomorrow! Thank you!",1
So cute! I love that it actually stays in and doesn't have to be adjusted every 2 seconds!,1
Love!!!,1
I LOVE my new earclimber! Fits my third piercing perfectly. I‚Äôll probably be back for more.,1
Love these gorgeous accessories! Well-crafted and quickly shipped and received. Will def do  repeat business with this shop again in the future!,1
"Seller worked w/ me well... 

Beautiful handmade earring.",1
"Very gorgeous and sexy. I love them, yes you get two for this great price!!",1
Gorgeous. I get so many compliments when I wear this.,1
Beautiful!,1
Love the way it looks.  Thanks!,1
"I love this. Originally ordered it to put on the 2nd piercing on both sides, but if I put it in my lower piercing, I can still put the teardrop earrings from the same shop in my upper piercing-- I love it and get a ton of compliments and questions on where I've obtained my earrings.",1
Beautiful and fits great! Always get compliments :),1
This piece was beautiful! Thank you.,1
Beautiful! These are my favorite earrings!,1
The earrings are lovely!  I've already received so many compliments :),1
These are very delicate I'm attractive earrings. I enjoyed the gold with the turquoise beads. Good quality and fast service.,1
Very cute and unique earrings!  Fast shipping - thanks!,1
I like them but too long for my ear!,1
"My first order arrived partially damaged from shipping. On one of the climbers, the beads had been busted and the metal was severely bent. I contacted the seller to see if I could get a single replacement and the seller quickly sent out a brand new pair, which are in perfect condition and fit my ears snugly. Very pleased with the service and product.",1
Very pretty. Got my earrings on time,1
"I love the concept of the ear climber- it's different from regular earrings and therefore appealing; once in place easy to wear. However, these and others I've tried don't stay in place after a while and must be re-set which is annoying. Do you have any hints to keep them ""climbing the ear""?",0
Fit was just a bit to big.,1
"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop.",1
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!",1
"These are even more gorgeous in person! Lovely packaging, timely delivery, and quality pieces! Couldn't be happier!",1
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.,1
"Beautiful! Lovely craftsmanship. A really unique piece that I love wearing, it gets a few compliments! Excellent seller.",1
"Love them!!! They look awesome with both.  Wonderful earrings!  Thanks so much for all the help, patience & speedy ship!",1
"Beautiful ear jackets that I always get compliments on them. Also, great customer service from this vendor. Very happy and will make more purchases from them!",1
I get nothing but compliments with these amazing ear jackets!!!! Awesome :),1
These are lovely! They are very unique and comfortable. I also like how versatile they are. You can wear just the bar studs for a more minimal look.,1
"Beautiful and well crafted earrings! 

Catie and Courtney were also wonderful to work with and personally made sure that earrings arrived on time to be gifted.

Great experience. Shop with confidence!",1
Gorgeous!  Easily my favorite earrings.  They are striking but perfect for everyday.  Thank you so much!,1
"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!",1

Gahhhh! So stunning. I just love them. Thank you!,1
"Earrings came about 1 week after placing order (5d to CA). They're very pretty and unique, I'll definitely order again from this shop. Came with 2 pairs of rubber backings- perfect because I promptly flung one of the backings into the nether regions of my bathroom upon trying them on. Fits perfect. The bars are large, if you want a daintier look maybe go with a different stud combo (ie the leaves with a smaller bar).",1
I am in love with these earrings!!!!,1
As described. I love the simple look of the ear jackets but how unique they still are. I can't wait to rock these!,1
"These are unique and beautiful, and I get lots of compliments on them. Had an issue with the first package and Catie was quick in resolving it and sending a replacement. Very grateful (and love this shop in general!)",1

I can't stop wearing these! I love them!,1
Beautifully constructed. Very unique. Arrived on time.,1
"The earrings are really pretty and one of a kind, but they're very expensive and a few things don't match the price: first, I would've liked to get proper silver backings instead of the cheap rubber ones, it feels like I have bought these earrings from some cheap teenage shop. And second, the packaging is quite bad, the earrings are hanging on a simple piece of cardboard, inside the tiniest cardboard box, coated with cheap foam. Apart from that, I love the earrings.",0
"Funky, beautiful, and comfortable to wear.",1
"Shipped on time, good quality, love it!",1
Just like the pictures.,1
Great quality and are very pretty on.,1

Love the earrings. Would use this seller again. Thanks.,1
These are beautiful earrings however for the price I paid I would expect a proper backing for the earring. the rubber ones that were sent I had problems with. They were slipping off and not staying in place.,0
"Very cool!  Well-made, and fast shipping - thanks!",1
"Beautiful earrings, but wish I had requested metal backs.  The plastic backers were hard on the posts, which bent when put on.",0
Cute earrings! Thank you for fast shipping!,1
Exactly as described and great product! Thanks :),1
Love the earrings! Service was poor. Given excuses when I asked where my item was. 7 days for a item to ship when it says 2-3 days!,0

"I really liked these earrings and bought them for myself and my two best friends.  One of them has already worn them and told me she's gotten many compliments.  They are light and thin so super easy to wear, but long enough to make a statement.  The owner also gave me a heads up that shipping time might take long, but came quicker than I expected with little lace bags to give as gifts.  The owner even threw in an initial ring, which was very nice.  I would recommend these, especially for the price!",1
Adore these earrings and the seller was very responsive.  great purchase overall and I am wearing them with EVERYTHING!,1
"Wonderful and responsive seller. These are easily one of my new favorite earrings (and included was a sweet midi ring, which I love!).

Definitely recommend!",1
These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!,1
"The item came beautifully wrapped and is as described. Shipping to Canada from Indonesia took over a month, but it was worth the wait! The X on the earring seems smaller than the photos - it is more suitable for people with smaller ears I think.",0
"Gorgeous earrings and absolutely amazing service! Delivery was much faster than expected and i received the earrings in a super cute little box, with personal handwritten messages AND a really pretty ring with my initial on it as a free (!) surprise gift. I love both the earrings and the ring, and wear them a lot, and can't praise Henju enough for the customer service. Will defo buy more stuff from her! :)",1

When I opened it I was thinking, ""it would be nice if these were a bit shinier,""...then I looked, and she included a polishing cloth!

Shipping took time.",1

They‚Äôre super cute and minimalistic and i‚Äôm definitely getting another pair from apartment020!,1

"they are AMAZING! feel super high quality, and come with two earring backs. i ordered a couple things from the shop, with this being for myself and the others gifts, so i recommend that if you‚Äôre buying multiple earrings for different people to try asking for different paper for each pair (what i wish i did!)",1
I love it!  It has a very calming effect and it's beautiful.  The quality is great and the service exceptional. I have ordered a number of bracelets from apartment020 and love everyone of them.,1

Ordered a custom bracket and was very happy with the final product. The seller was a pleasure to work with. I would definitely order from this shop again.,1
"Perfectly crafted sparkling star earrings for my teen niece. She loved them, and I love how beautifully it was wrapped and boxed! Thank you! üíú",1
"I got these as a gift for someone, so can't speak to using them personally.  But the shipping was quite fast (considering), and they look great.  They are smaller than expected (less than 1cm) but I probably just didn't read the measurements.  Overall I'm quite happy.",1
I believe the service was truly exceptional....communication was a awesome and I do appreciate the effort made with my custom request....the design exceeded my expectations and I plan to do more business in the very near future...I highly recommend this customer...,1

"I love these little earrings! Christmas gift for myself. Great customer service too, so that's a giant plus!",1
I mistakenly thought the bracelets had not arrived. The small package had fallen down between other larger packages and I finally found it. All my fault. I give the seller lots of credit because she went to the ends of the earth to help me locate package (feel so bad!) and she even offered me a refund. The bracelets are very good quality! The jade color is gorgeous! I thought the rose quartz would be more pink-more like it looked in the photos. I hope the seller can forgive me for my mistake! Thank you Apt020 for the pretty bracelets!!,0

"GET IT. It looks really good, everybody thinks it is the mejuri one. Only reason it is not 5 stars is because the clasp is not gold plated i guess and has turned brown, I also saw little glimmers of the corroding color on the chains, but mostly it looks like it did when I first got it. (I do wear my necklaces in the shower and swimming though and this one has held up well for the month-ish I've had it.)",1

I ordered these earrings very close to Christmas and she was SO kind and accommodating. I received the earrings so quickly and they were packaged so nicely and with a sweet note! It‚Äôs also really nice that these fit really nicely around my second earring, since the piercing is still rather new and I like to keep the earrings in. So beautiful! They‚Äôre my new favorites!",1
"Beautiful earrings, very comfortable.  Shipping was so incredibly fast, I got it far before I expected to.  The only thing I would caution other buyers about is that if you have smaller ears/earlobes the earrings might not stay upright very well.  I didn't think about it before ordering, but I do have smaller lobes and the fit isn't snug enough to stay exactly where I'd like.  That's my fault for not considering it though, and I do still love the earrings even though they end up a bit diagonal on me.  Thank you very very much!!!",1
"Absolutely fabulous!
I was expecting them to have more of a hand-made look, but no, they are polished, and even, and just beautiful! Will wear them on my wedding! 10/10 would recommend.",1

"Kathy is so talented! I adore these earrings and wear then daily. They are so unique and I get so many compliments!!

Completely worth the wait! Kathy was quick to respond with updates as she handmade each piece. Took about 4 weeks to receive.",1
My new faves!!! Love them so much! Thank you so much,1

"This has to be my most favourite purchase on Etsy and one of my most favourite pendants. I‚Äôve been on the hunt for a good scarab necklace because of my fascination and love for Ancient Egypt but nothing has ever caught my eye as much as this pendant. I‚Äôve been wearing it since I received it yesterday and I am head over heels in love. The pendant has quite a solid weight, the details very subtle but still evident and all in all a very, very beautiful and excellent piece of work. The slim chain that I got with it is very sturdy and matches very well with the pendant. Kathy is a lovely seller, she answered all my questions and even included a little gift with my purchase. Will buy from her again!!!!",1
"Absolutely gorgeous! I'm in love with these earrings, thank you for the extra gift!",1
"I ADORE these earrings! Worn them pretty much every day since I got them. The gold on the post wore off a teeny bit, but the part of the earring you can actually see / care about still looks great 2+ months later. Would re-buy.",1
Love it so much! I get complimements every time i wear it,1
"Beautifully made! I've never seen anything like it, it's a real eyecatcher and I get tons of compliments whenever I wear it.",1
"Absolutely gorgeous! I'm in love with these earrings, thank you for the extra gift!",1
"My order was custom maid, the large moon pendant with blue stones in silver because my friend is allergic to anything else. Kathy was always quick with answering any question and providing assistance. The order was ready after 2 weeks as she promised and arrived quick and safely wrapped. Her work is beautiful and perfect. One can see that it is made with love. It won‚Äòt be my last order! :)",1
"These are my everyday go-to earrings now and I LOVE them! (Also, yes, they took some time to get here but it was well within the timeline given by the seller and I knew what I was getting into when I made my purchase. Definitely worth the wait!!)",1
I LOVE this ring!!! üòçüòç It‚Äôs better than I expected and I‚Äôm super stoked that I bought it because I‚Äôm wearing it all the time now.,1
I love all moon jewelry this earrings is next in my collection üòç,1
"J‚Äôadore <3 bons contacts avec la vendeuse, et bijoux magnifiques !",1
"Oh my god it‚Äôs amazing! Really beautiful, and it is a little heavy but that‚Äôs kind of reassuring of its quality and to make sure it‚Äôs there. The only thing I‚Äôll say is AirPods can be used with them but they hang out slightly when the earring is in",1
"Lovely and light!

I only wear jumbo earrings and am used to them being heavy. 

It was nice to find that these are feather light and so elegantly constructed. The closer is different from shown in the listing photos and I think is a design improvement. 

Love!",1
"The necklace, though smaller than I thought, is absolutely stunning. It has a very minimalist style and definitely was ~the~ chain necklace I‚Äôve been looking for- not too chunky, not too bulky, just the right amount of both. While it has a good weight, it is not uncomfortable to wear and because of its simplistic style, layering it with other necklaces is not a problem. In addition, Kathy is an amazing seller!!! She is a very easy person to communicate with and very sweet as well! Will come back for more!",0
"In theory I love the way these look. In practice they don‚Äôt work. The heavy hoop pulls the suspenders off your ear‚Äôs fold, so they stick out at angles and look dorky. Sigh. They‚Äôre lovely. They just don‚Äôt work the way they‚Äôre meant to.

Later reducing to one star, as the welding just snapped. Will return.",0
Such a cool and unique piece of jewelry. I live it! Looks great. Seems to be a good quality. Very happy with this purchase.,1

"These earring are super duper rad and well made......buuuuut they turn my ears a color so I‚Äôm not quite sure the whole earring is sterling silver. In any case, this probably won‚Äôt deter me from by one of the other cool designs.",0

Amazing piece!  And Kathy was very responsive was able to make a small change to the earring to fit my needs. Overall a wonderful seller and experience!  Thank you!,1
"BE CAREFUL!  The horns are razor sharp!  First time wearing it, and last, the ring not only dug into my finger and poked it to blood, but when I was resting my face on my hand, while at a restaurant, and then moved it to gesture, one of the horns caught my lip and tore it to blood. In addition, this ring tore a perfect line-cut in my favorite shirt when I reached behind myself, even though the ring faced out and away from my back.  It looks like I used an exacto-knife to cut my shirt.  I cannot imagine someone  handling a baby or pets while wearing this ring.  I politely reached out to seller almost a month ago to return this ring but she never responded!  The audacity! And Etsy had the nerve to deny my case b/c it 'looks as described'.  I filed a case with BBB and my credit card company.  Worst shopping experience of my life!",0
"Lovely earrings, could have done with another hole option for the rear post though!",1
Kathy‚Äôs work is outstanding. Well made. The stone is magnificent and well set. My fiance hasn‚Äôt taken it off for over a year now. She says girls (both coworkers and strangers) grab her hand and praise it‚Äôs beauty nearly every day.,1
"Thank you again, dear! Just received the package last night and already wearing them today! <3",1

"love these earrings. They are climbers, but they aren't obnoxiously climbers, so if you're looking for something that is similiar, but not all the way up your earlobe, these are the ones. The titanium is great for my daughter who has a nickel allergy. We have the silver matte finish, and I am thinking about orderring a pair for myself, or maybe stealing my daughter's pair. ships from Greece, so it does take a minute getting here, but they are beautifully wrapped.

"These earrings are beautiful and very well made. Sadly, they didn't work for me, but the return process was very easy and fast. I will defiantly buy from this shop again",1
"Lovely earrings. I bought two without even thinking I might get two for the same ear, as these are advertised singularly, but man is she good and sent me one for each ear!!!!  Just love them! Stunning statement without being gaudy üòç",1
I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.,1

I love my new pair of earrings! I get so many compliments about them!,1
"I really love these. As far as earring jackets go they are pretty unique in design/pattern and I really like that. Honestly,  I find them a little pricey compared to what I am used to paying in the U.S. even from handmade artisans, but not a ton, and their uniqueness was enough to make me want to buy them anyway. Quality was great. If the prices went down a little I'd probably buy a lot more but can't say I would at this time priced as they were when I bought them.",1
These earrings are exquisite!  I'm going to wear them every day for the rest of my life.  feminine & sweet,1

"This is the first time I‚Äôve purchased from Poppychain and USPS had unfortunately lost my package. However, after informing Kat, she was so responsive and helpful in trying to call my local USPS and locating it (which is a whole frustrating task in itself), and then finally having to send another order out which I appreciated a lot. I love the small minimal earrings I bought. They were exactly as described in the descriptions and photos. I am looking forward to wearing more items from the shop! thanks Kat!",1

"Very beautiful and delicate. Came in right on time. Actually I believe it came in early. Sadly I didn't pay attention to the description and got one I was allergic to. I sent in an email and got an immediate response  concerning my situation. She was very nice and more than happy to help. She aloud me to exchange my item for something I was not allergic to and was completely understanding. I was shocked because most shops and stores won't let you return specific jewelry even if it hadn't been used. Just make sure you read the description of what you're purchasing before you complete the transaction. That was my mistake. Overall, I would recommend to anyone!! 
Very happy that we have good people out there with all the chaos going on!!üòÑ",0
"Beautiful chain, worked exactly how I wanted it to!",1

Just as described!,1
Super fast shipping! Thanks!,1
"Is ok for the price but not worth putting on earrings on the earlobes. They‚Äôre so small and dainty you can‚Äôt even see them. If you want to see one dangle, get it longer than an inch. Even after I write this, I‚Äôm still trying to use them on a conch piercing, but will not fit. So shop wisely cause you can‚Äôt return these.",0
"The chain is a little flimsy, but it gives the look I want for an affordable price :)",1
This earing is so beautiful! I am so glad I bought it. It's beautiful and very well made. I love that it's not a stud so it doesn't hurt at all. I love love love this earing!,1
"So it took a while to get this little guy but I absolutely LOVE it! I got it for my cartilage piercing and it fits perfectly! Stylish and flows perfectly with my upper ear. Super sturdy too, so I think it‚Äôll hold up well for daily wear!",1
These are so fun! I switch them between my second and third holes- the texture catches the light just so!,1
I fell in love with these earrings as soon as I put them on!! They‚Äôre absolutely gorgeous!,1
Absolutely beautiful! I would give these a 5 star rating if they didn't slip out of the ear so easily. I think they need to come with small rubber backs to keep them secure. I have already lost one and I am so disappointed..,0
Voor mijn vriendin gekocht. Ze is er super blij mee! Heel mooi en subtiel,1
Awesome!,1
"Merci beaucoup, elles sont magnifiques !
Tout a fait conforme",0
"Editing my review. Gorgeous piece in solid gold that appears to contour with your ear well. However, it just wouldn‚Äôt stay up, and kept falling out of my piercing. Any attempts to pinch it shut more or to add a rubber earring back to at least keep it in my ear just made it more uncomfortable to wear. I love the look, but I sadly won‚Äôt be wearing it much.",0
"The customer service was fast and lovely. The package came with a handwritten note and a cute lollipop ü•∞, thanks! The earcuffs are very nice - they are easy to put on, they don't pinch the ear and they fit snugly, and most of all - are as pretty as they were on the pictures provided by KivotosJewelry. 10/10 would buy again üòÅ",1
I really like it. You can adjust the hook so it can fit your ear shape,1

The dark purple and green leaves are gorgeous and I‚Äôm sure my friend will love this as much as I did when I opened the parcel.,1

"As always, beautiful product, fast international shipping. I get most of my earrings from Shlomit Ofir, and I get so many compliments! Love this designer.",1
I wanted the leaf climber for my right ear.  Make sure you specify which ear.,1
WELL worth the wait through customs honestly! quality is great and they're so cute! i know i'll get a lot of wear out of them,1
Same thing as the tiny hoops. They are so cute! Just a bit faded/worn on the part that goes into the earlobe.,1
These are my new daily earrings! I LOVE them. Thank you!,1

"I love all the jewelry! It came in such a cute box, really good quality and it looks even prettier than in the pictures :-) Love it! Thank you!",1
The earrings are nice but if you have thick lobes like mine it won't look as good as in the pictures.,1
"These hoops are the perfect size and look cute, for whatever reason the part that goes into the ear is worn and I can see the metal underneath the gold coating.",1

"The earrings are beeaautiful! Thank you so much for your talent of creating such extraordinary pieces. Can‚Äôt emphasize enough how much I love the design.

The earring backs are rubber, which are kind of a disservice to the elegant piece. But I‚Äôll take the compromise for the 24K plating than lower quality plating. Cost, cost, cost.

I impart the warning to others to be mentally prepared of VERY delayed shipping during this health crisis. The shipping from Israel to NYC was A MONTH ‚Äî and there were many days where there were no shipping updates whatsoever (not seller‚Äôs fault; 75% delay due to Israel Post and 25% delay due to USPS). That said, her reliable communication helped my eager self to be patient.",0

These are so cute... even the packaging was cute! Great craftsmanship,1
"When I first received this ring, I was in love. It was just what I was looking for. Sadly, after about 2 weeks of wearing it, the white enamel became discolored and just peeled off. Now I just have a plan gold ring that looks pretty tacky. I'm pretty bummed considering how expensive it was. My advice would be to not buy this ring if you plan on wearing it everyday. It will not withstand everyday use.",0
"Really like the bracelet--but I wish it was just a little longer--is a little snug on me--nice gold color
I will add on 2 links to make it fit better",1
Ces boucles d'oreille sont parfaites !,0
These are a show stopper. I have not worn it once without people asking about it and giving me compliments,0
I get a lot of compliments on these!  Very good quality.,1
Beautiful little set. Sized more for a child than for an adult but the quality is amazing. Shipping was over a month from Israel to US.,1
Better than I anticipated! Came in the cutest box and in a glass bottle. This necklace is so Dainty and perfect!,1

The earrings are lovely but uncomfortable. The wire that goes through the ear seems to be thicker than the wires/posts in my other pairs of earrings.  I could see myself wearing these every day if only they were comfortable. Disappointed.,0

Beautiful. Many thanks really like these earings,1
"It's a beautiful ring. Unique shape. A little sharp on the edges, so I have to be mindful not to wear it around my toddler or do any drastic face sweeps, else I scratch skin.",1
"Awesome ring. Wearing it with such pride! 
Thank you!!!! Gorgeous!",1
"Magnifique, comme toujours. Envoi rapide, soign√© et bijou d'une grande finesse.",1
"It's so beautiful, but it broke within 5 minutes of opening. We glued it back together, but it's very fragile.",0
Just as gorgeous in person. Already looking for more pieces from this shop.,1
"Really love them, but i had to pay 15 euros of customs...",1

It was a present for my sister and she absolutely loved them. Thank you!,1
Looks beautiful.  This is a gift.  Item arrived very quickly and was very pleased.  It looks to be of great quality.  Would love to get one for me!,1
"REALLY DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING FROM THIS SHOP.
I have been waiting for this item over two month now and no one from the shop has come back to me. I am extremely disappointed by the service and by how unprofessional SHLOMIT OFIR has been. I am still waiting for my refund and no one came back to me. If you want to lose some money, buy from this shop!",0
The ring is exactly as pictured!,1
The ring is lovely - thank you!,1
"A perfect gift, very cute and well presented.",1
"Beware of ordering from this company! They say ‚Äúfast shipping‚Äù which is absolutely untrue. I get that COVID has made things challenging, but the tracking on my end shows that the package has not left Israel as of today, and I ordered the gift on Dec 5th. Now, they are not agreeing to provide me with a full refund.

Buyer Beware! It‚Äôs a scam.",0
"Classy ring, just love it--in silver   great style and value",1

Very pretty anklet! Thank you!,1
Earrings were very pretty but unfortunately gave me an allergic reaction,0
Arrived in good time and my mum loved it!,1
"Lovely and quick shipping, thank you!",1
"Can only give one star as I never received my order. When I contacted the seller, she was completely dismissive and offered no ways to help.
Ordered was expected on 12/15-16. It is now 12/29.",0
"I come to Etsy to support artists, not con artists. Not worth the money (tacky) and poor customer service. I looked at the measurements before ordering and this still feels smaller than I expected. The disrespect and disregard from the seller made me feel like my business or happiness was not important at all. 

The color for the mountains is not flush with the wood...it‚Äôs cheap laminate glued on. Not what I expected for something that is normally $62. 

Comes in a bag that says ‚Äúuse two nails or screws to install‚Äù....Umm this was over $50 so You definitely need to include all of the hardware required. 

All in all, strongly DONT recommend.",0
"Great birthday gift, unique and arrived swiftly!",1
"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it.",1
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!,0
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit.",1
"Beautiful, well crafted & unique earrings! Great customer service; I will definitely shop here again.",1

Receive several compliments on this ear jacket. Very nice!,1
"I am EXTREMELY happy with my beautiful earrings. 

When I ordered these, the package had to go through ""customs"" and unfortunately were not repacked properly and subsequently were lost. I  contacted the shop/vendor and they immediately sent out another pair and secured the new pair to make sure proper receipt of my order. Great customer service and lovely craftsmanship of jewelry.",1
Granddaughter loved these!,1
A sophisticated take on an ear jacket.,1
I don‚Äôt believe the shipping was the seller‚Äôs fault although it took a month for the item to arrive.  The seller was very responsive to my inquiry.,0
"If there was a way to make the earring one piece, I would rate 5 stars. I like the look a lot but they are difficult to get on with 2 pieces and then the back. Already lost one piece down the baseboard and took 30 min to fish it out. Other than that, cute!!",0
Did not fit my ear very well,0
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!",1
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again.",1
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it.",1
They are beautiful! My ears are not sensitive to metal either! Yaye!,0
I love my earpins!  Packed well and shipped quickly.,1
I have really sensitive ears. And multiple piercing holes in my ears that I dont use and hope to cover up. These are perfect! My ears are not unhappy either which is a big win for me!!!,0
"Favoriting the shop and on the look out for new designs. 

Not as rose gold as I thought it would be but i loooove the look of it :) 

It's pretty comfortable and so far it feels nonexistent on my ears. I have incredibly sensitive ears as well, so that's saying a lot.",1
A really fun and cool piece of jewelry. Sits nicely on my ear and looks very pretty!,1
These earrings worked out great for my bridesmaids! The fact that they are surgical steel made it so I didn't ave to worry about allergies and they fit all of their ears without slipping or falling.,1
"These earrings came quickly and were well packed. I like that they can be worn over the piercing (more like a cuff) or through it (although I've had a little trouble getting them in that way but that's user error!). They will be perfect for our Fall, outdoor engagement pics! Thanks again!",1
"Just as beautiful as the pictures, easy to put on, stayed in place most of the day. A little long for my ear, but they still look great.",1
These earrings are great! They are exactly like the picture and came very quickly. I would definitely buy from this shop again.,1
"I'm very satisfied with these. They're my first pair of ear climbers, and they do exactly what they're supposed to do. They are a good size, too, but don't dwarf your ear or anything. For the price the quality is quite good.",1
Great quality product. Love them!,1
"Lovely! My first pair of climber earrings, and they are comfortable and stay in place. Very pleased.",1
Very beautiful and easy to wear with everything,1
"El Brillo, la textura, el dise√±o",0
Earrings are adorable!,1
Really nice quality!,1
Good quality product and fast shipping for coming from Canada to USA. Got the earrings as a present for my sister and she loves them.,1
"Bought these for my 14 year old and she has been wearing them since I gave them to her, 5 days straight! And she almost never wears earrings. They look great :)",1
Really beautiful pieces=-) They have a tendency to let go of my ear and hang down though.,1
I really like these earrings but they always swing down and don‚Äôt stay in place. Not sure if it‚Äôs my ears or the product.,0
"I LOVE these earrings!!  My ear piercing closed, but I'm still able to wear these by securing it under my ear lobe. I (reluctantly) gave my mom the other pair that I bought because she loved it too!",1
I feel like a forest fairy every time I wear them. They came promptly and the metal is ok even for my sensitive ears.,1
"Beautiful earrings, exactly as pictured and arrived quickly!!",1
Very cute- exactly as pictured.,1
Wear them daily! Great for sensitive ears!,1
Beautiful earrings. Arrived quickly. No hassle!,1
Beautiful item and great quality. However it would be great if it was easier to figure out wether an item was sent as a single earring or a pair. I ordered two because the description said ‚Äòear vine‚Äô without a plural. I thought I‚Äôd get one pair of two not two pairs.,0
"like it, wish it was a post, not a wire.",0
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!",1
Love the earrings. So dainty and unusual.Prompt transaction and would recommend.,1

Very good quality and beautifully crafted. The packaging was incredibly beautiful and felt like a lot of love and thought had been put into it‚Äîa very pleasant surprise!,1
"This was my second purchase of these earnings as when my daughter saw them she wanted some! They arrived promptly and were beautifully wrapped in recycled material. They are much sturdier than I expected and i have not taken them out since i got my first pair about a month ago which means I have showered, slept and gone swimming with them in (probably not a good idea but I'm lazy about changing my earrings). I love them!",1
"Perfect earrings, and WOW how beautiful your lettering was on the envelope!",1
"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)",1
Wundersch√∂n. Die Gr√∂√üe ist perfekt.,1

"The moonstone is more a bright white stone. It‚Äôs super pretty but doesn‚Äôt have the flashes of blue I‚Äôm used to with moonstone. That said, it‚Äôs super pretty",1
"I chose the blanco color and they are beautiful! Good quality, size as indicated in the pics;  easy to put on and keep on.",1
Gorgeous product. Even better than expect. I bought them as a Christmas present for my best friend and I know she will love them. Extra points for the cute leather pouch and personalized note. This is why I continue to shop on esty.  üíï,1
Really beautiful - bought these on a whim and they are absolutely lovely in person. Really recommend them. Great design,1
Shipped very quickly and is very cute and comfortable in my ear! Love!,1

Love this earring it's extremely dainty for a bigger piece completely in love with it! Will definitely be using again in the future,1
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.,1
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!",1
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size.",1
So pretty! It is more dainty in person than what I was imagining from the picture but I was pleasantly surprised!  I am planning on wearing it at my wedding and it will match well with my  other jewelry. Thank you!,1
Arrived quickly and packaged with love. Beautiful quality!  Stunning piece. So happy. I love it. Thank u so much!,1
Love this! It's so different! Great customer service! Would work with seller again. However this earring is very difficult to put on and I lost the earring  a weeks after purchase. Hard to screw the back in and it comes loose.,1
So pretty.  Perfect size for my second hole.  I loved these.,1
Very cute and exactly what I was looking for. I always use 1/4 bar but I wished I ordered the next size up,1
"Gorgeous! Fancy, looks great in the helix!",1

Beautiful earrings. I bought two cartilage earrings and a pair of lobe regular earrings for a wedding I will attend.  These are the two cartilage.,1

"So this earring is adorable. It is so cute and I have gotten tons of compliments on it. My only problem with the earring is that it will not stay in my ear. It has fallen out 4 times in the past few days. Luckily I have been able to find it when it falls out, but it makes me not want to wear it all the time because I know it is going to fall out and I am going to lose it",1

Just fabulous!! The earrings are of great quality. Super cute packaging! I will definitely be ordering another pair!,1
"Let me say this first: I absolutely love this style of earring. However, the quality of the white blocks was very low, and they looked very messy, and I really don't feel the price was justified. But, I do love the earrings quite a bit, its just if I had known now what I do, I wouldn't have paid more than $10 for them.",1
they are the best like always!,1

Great item and fast shipment. Thanks!,1
I loved the way they looked. However I wore them 1 day and took them off at night and the front square came off the post. Tried contacting the shop 3 times and never got a response.,0
"Very nice earrings, arrived kinda dirty though.",1
I wish they were a bit smaller. There very heavy/large which make them look awkward. I like the concept but too big .,0

Nice piece. Def quality in the work and well built.,1
They were very good quality but were much larger than I expected.,1
The bar that holds the back stud hung down below my ear lobe. It looked funny. Tried twice to contact seller  but no response from them. I will not buy from this seller again.,0
I love these ear climbers so much! Very pretty!!,1
I have never written a review before on anything I purchase.. Maybe I'm too lazy. Anyway. These earrings are outstanding. The quality. The color of gold. The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!,1

"Earring broke within 24 hours. Reached out to the store and did not hear back. Luckily I was able to glue it back together. Love the earrings, just wish I hadn't needed to fix them so soon and that I had gotten some sort of response.",0
"I love these, especially the jacket part! The adjustable height is great for me (I have small earlobes and many jackets just don't fit me), and the simple design pairs well with all kinds of other stud earrings, not just the ones that come as part of this set. I'm currently wearing them with some lime green studs and have gotten multiple compliments on the interesting combo! The jacket is comfortable, but do know you have to push the butterfly back down the post to hold it in place, which takes some time to get used to if like me you normally keep the back at the end of the post.",1
"LOVE LOVE LOVE!  These earrings are perfect, really cute and subtle, easy to wear every day, and also great for dressing up.  Beautifully packaged, and arrived on time.",1

Adorable earrings in adorable packaging! They arrived quickly and are lovely; my only quibble is that the tiny ear climbers are a little too tiny for my plump earlobes. I flared them out and put them in my second holes and I think they're going to work!,1

"Well made and timely shipping!!!

Perfect for daily wear!,1
I love these earrings! I just have to be careful not to wear them in the shower so I don't keep losing them down the drain. Great choice for people who have difficulty with studs and want something other than dangly earrings.,1
Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for!!,1
"2nd Purchase from Littionary, love this simple pair as much as my others!",1
product as described but matte finish seems to wear quickly - currently wearing backwards as the finish is the normal and holding up much better,1
"Fantastic earring. Was confused about the ""single"" or ""pair"".Didn't realize that you only get one single earring. I feel silly now that only one came in the package. Quality is fantastic however, took ages to ship.",1
Beautiful earrings. Super fast delivery!!!! Highly recommended!!!,1
"Very cute and danty as described, my only issue would be that the earring is either very easily scratched or changes color a bit.  I barely wore it and the front of it has a streak that is discolored.  I am not sure if it was just unlucky.  All in all it's not too noticeable and i still think its quite cute!",0
Very unique - I didn't even know these were exactly what I was looking for.,0

Thank you. They were very well received.,1
Perfect earrings! Very fast shipping. Will buy from seller again.,1
So cute; shipped promptly. Thanks so much!,1
Beautiful but its hard to make them tight enough to fully stay on my ear as a climber. I wanted to wear these every day and not take them off but after a few days wear there is some tarnishing on the backs.,0
These climbers hold onto my ear and stay in place all day. They are very thin so they are even harder to keep track of than other earrings.,0
"very delicate, fast shipping. Thank you!",1
"Love it, every time I lose one I have to buy more.",1
Best earrings! They stay on my ears and I can't even feel them.,1
Great product and fast shipping!,1
Bought these as a Christmas gift for my sister.  She loved them!,1
"It was beautiful, but was just a bit big for my ears and didn‚Äôt seem to fit well. Mostly a difference of expectation though!",1
"Earring fell out numerous times. After 3 days, and even after adding my own backs, I lost one. They refunded the cost of one earring but I found their customer service to be impersonal and uncaring. Disappointed and not worth the price.",0
"Wonderful! They fit securely, are very lightweight, and so amazingly unique! These were just what I was looking for! :)",1
"The item shipped really quickly! I love them, they're really detailed!",1
"I'm so happy with these earrings, they are absolutely stunning!!",1
I love them to bits ! delivery was on time & nicely wrapped. Will definitely buy from this seller again !,1
I love them!!! I love this style so much!!!! Great job!!!!!,1
Such a beautiful well crafted earring. It‚Äôs very comfortable to wear and sits nicely on the ear. I absolutely love it!,1
"The earrings are lovely, very detailed work, and they look amazing on!",1
"Stunning detail, just an absolutely gorgeous piece!! Worth every penny, nickel, quarter and dime.",1
"They look REALLY gorgeous, but for some reason they won't stay ""up"" on one of my ears. :(",1
so glad u recommended the bend. I LOVE THEM,1
"Very pretty, perfect size, excellent shipping!",1
They are awesome ! Got them a lot quicker than I thought. Thanks so much!,1
"Arrived in great condition! I have to do some adjusting to get them to stay up the way I want them to sit, but it's not a big issue. Still beautiful earrings and lighter than expected! I wore them to go see Thor and completely forgot I was wearing earrings!",1
Earrings arrived quickly and were beautifully wrapped :-) Will definitely shop here again.,1
"super cute and comfortable! they don't stay put when I try to wear them across my ear like the model (they stick out and down a little), so I just wear them vertically. I still love them, giving 4 instead of 5 stars because they didn't turn out to be what I thought they were going to... but still recommend!!!",1
Absolutely beautiful earrings and fast shipping! Thank you so much! (and sorry this feedback took so long..),1
Awesome! Thank you!!,1
I hope I will be one with these earrings in Russia :),1
"I get compliments on these earrings all the time because of how striking and sharp they look. but they are heavier than average earrings and it took some time before my ears got used to them. The part of the earring that pierces through your lobes is (too) short for the backing of the earring, and it is located on the wider part of the wing design, so that the earring kind of hangs heavy on the bottom, which makes it a bit awkward to wear. Contrary to how it's advertised, because of the unequal weight distribution on either end of the wing design, you cannot wear the earrings like Rihanna wore hers (i.e. with the slimmer end of the wings pointing upwards). Overall, I am satisfied with the product and the price. It is a good find.",1
Love these earrings with fast delivery.,1
Awesome:)) I get lots of compliments :),1
Great to work with. Great Earrings,1
"These earring are very pretty! They look really cool when wearing them up, or down and are comfy.",1
AMAZING! Thanks so much.,1
A very cute accessory that has an edge to it. It took a little while for it to arrive.,1
Very lightweight to wear & very detailed - great everyday earrings.,1
Awesome! Exactly what I was looking for!,1
Thank you! Lovely earrings :),1
The earrings are perfect. I would buy from this seller again.,1
"Gorgeous earrings, great service and swift delivery.",1
"Love seller's style.  Unfortunately, I don't wear these as often as I'd like because I was under the impression they would sit upright on my ear.  After a little tweaking and bending they just don't fit my ear right.  So I can only wear them down, which gives them a cool edgy rocker feel.",1
"Awesome, she loved them! Thanks!",1
"These beautiful earings are much bigger than I expected and the post doesn't seem to be in the bright place and they therefore do not sit upright on your ear, but stick out a little like Spock ears. They are quite solid and I don't think they look quite right pointing down. I am going to make them into a brooch or a necklace instead.",0
very cute and seller is really nice <3,1
"Awesome earrings :). My friend is going to love them as a her b-day gift. Also, they arrived quicker than I previously thought.",1
These earrings hang down and I thought they would look different but still nice,1
"The earring themselves are beautiful, but there's no way they stay up. I'm actually quite disappointed and will give them away. :(",0
Fast shipping (arrived in the 6 day bracket after shipping notice) but I don't really like these earrings as much as I thought I would. They look very luxurious in the pictures but they seem quite dull in real life. Little disappointing for the $18 price tag.,1
"The wings don't stay in place. They droop down. I was really looking forward to wearing these, but was disappointed.",0
"Bad quality, absolutely poor crap, already broken when they arrived and these wing earrings can not be put on the ears, too heavy and cheap. Don't make the same mistake as me and buy this crap.",0
"Love it! It's a little bit loose and gets facing weird directions but of course it does. It's gorgeous, exactly what I wanted!",1
Beautiful piece. Thank you so much.,1
"very nice piece but too thick of a piercing neck on the earring for my cartilage hole, need to force stretch the hole to fit this piece.",0
The earrings took two weeks to arrive. It was totally okay it's understandable because I ordered it on the 22nd of December. The earrings are simple and beautiful. I definitely needed a youtube video to help me put them on. After viewing the video it takes you seconds to put them on. Totally worth the money! Must by,0
"Love it! got great compliments already from the first day I put it on! FYI, must read and understand the size of the item. I was anticipating a little bigger. Picture can be deceiving, but I'm absolutely satisfied with my purchase.",1
Went perfectly with my gold dress! Made it in plenty of time for my event.,1
"I love this earrings! They‚Äôre very unique and I love to wear them! It‚Äôs a new style! The seller is a wonderful and helpful person. Even though there were some difficulties with shipping, she was very active & did everything to make me get my oder. Thank you so much BenittaMoko! ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"Wundervoll und hochwertig verarbeitet, ein toller diskreter aber raffinierter Hingucker. Es ist sehr angenehm zu tragen und ich bin total begeistert =)",0

"Ich liebe meine neuen Ohrringe!!!
Sehen total edel aus und lassen sich toll tragen. Sind ganz leicht, nicht sp√ºrbar und gut verarbeitet.",0
Love them!,1
"I previously posted that I couldn't get the earrings to stay in place, but I was pretty sure it was me and not the earrings. I was right! I tried them again today, and they're staying in place just fine. I love them! 

Arrived fast, and they're lovely, but I just can't get them to rest in my ear the way they do in the photos. I wear them pointing down instead, and am happy with them, but wish I could get them to stay put long-wise. I'm pretty sure it's due to the shape of my ears / user error, though, and not the earrings themselves. :)",1
These are super comfortable and fashionable with any type of outfit. I get compliments each time I wear them ‚ò∫Ô∏è,1
Absolutely love these earrings! My favorite pair to wear. Always get compliments. Thank you!,1

Perfect!!!,1
"I absolutely love these earrings. I have received so many compliments about how they are ""so you.""  I never like wearing earrings because they usually are heavy on my ears or poke my head behind my ears. Most earrings irritate my skin, but these don't. These ones are light weight and lay in my ear naturally. i cant even feel them. I could sleep in them! Thank you, i will definitely be back!",1
I love them! They look beautiful and understated.,1
"I love these earrings, so pretty and individual. Thank you üòä",1

SUPER CUTE! It arrived within time frame.I would definitely recommend this piece easy to put on and comfortable.,1
These are so beautiful and lightweight,1
"G√©nial et parfait, merci !!!",1
"I almost never take the time to write reviews, but had to make an exception because I LOVE these earrings!
They fit snugly on my ear and do not slip around at all, but also don't pinch and are so comfortable that I often forget to take them off before bed. They are also are even prettier and daintier in person and I get tons of compliments. I also have very sensitive skin and the metal doesn't irritate it at all.
I wear them almost every day-- cannot recommend enough :)",1
"These are beautiful and well made, but I found them a little long for my petite ears. Be careful to measure your lobes when ordering climbers, and adjust if you need to find something smaller!",1
"Es hat alles super geklappt, vielen Dank!!
Die Ohrklemme ist sehr fein verarbeitet und sieht sehr sch√∂n aus!!",1
Sehr sch√∂ner Ohring! Schnelle Lieferung!,0

"Beautiful earrings, exactly as shown. A great present. Would certainly buy again.",1
Very simple and minimalist. Stays the way it's supposed to most of the time if I'm not touching it. Have gotten sevral compliments but I love it for the tiny detail and slight shininess it creates.,1
Items are exactly as described and stay in place very well. Really beautiful pieces!!,1
¬°Me encantaron los aretes! S√∫per delicados y edgy a la vez.,1

Very cute! Happy with purchase,1
"Really nice earrings, fit perfectly and impress around me :)",1
Purchased this item in both gold & silver and I love it.  Came in mail very quickly.  Will purchase again from this seller,1
Really beautyful errings - Ilove them.,1
Very cute. loved the ear climbers!,1
Really beautiful .. Thank you.. Will recommend this store,1
These earrings are beautiful and well made.,1
These are beautiful earrings and arrived within the projected time. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they keep sliding down off my ears every 15ish minutes. It's a bit frustrating. But I have small lobes in length and thickness so this probably wouldn't be a concern for most.,1
"The package took 32 days to arrive to my home.  I like the hammered look of the earrings.  The earrings seem like shaped wire, they are flexible which I did not expect.  The earrings ""loosen"" and because they do not fit my ear perfectly I need to keep adjusting them throughout the day. The ends slide down and stick off my ear.  Of course everyone's ears are not shaped the same but I did not forsee this happening.

I do get lots of compliments and they are a very unique idea, but I could have hammered some wire myself for less than $30.",0
LOVE!! Going to buy more!,1
"attention √† la forme de vos oreilles 
en tout cas service serieux livraison ok",1
Yes it shipped on time and love the earrings,1
Very nice and cool! Looks great.,1
"Everything fine! Beautiful earrings, thank you!",1
"Stunning ear cuffs. Getting lots of compliments when wearing them, the only complaint is that they don‚Äôt stay in place very well and I frequently have to check that they are still in place.",1
Perfect article! Received on time and looks beautiful. Thank you!,1
Look as great as on the photo. Fast delivery.,1
This seller is very helpful,1
"simple, different. good quality and interesting",1

"Shipped earlier than expected. Lovely, lovely, thank you.",1
"very pretty earrings, good quality",1
"Beautiful earrings! I was a bit worried about how these would feel, but they are very comfortable and don't budge in my ears.",1
"These arrived right on time, exactly as pictured, and with the ideal amount of pinch.  (Effective, but not painful.)",0
I love how delicate they are but my only complaint is the part of the earring that sits through my ear is very short so the earrings make my ears very sore.  I only wore them for a few hours and when I took them out the holes where my ears are pierced were red and swollen.  I'll still try to wear them but only for a very short period of time.,1
"Very delicate and pretty, kind of painful to wear for too long",0
Material is thinner than it looks.,0
"Still waiting for product, received email from seller, will edit when I receive package- don't know how to delete a review.",0
I didnt receive my item yet.,0
"I love them so much; I didn't understand how to put them on at first, but it took me less than 2 minutes. If they feel loose, I can just squeeze them a bit. I would definitely buy more, plus they came in the cutest little corkscrew bottle ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera.",1
"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!",1
"OBSESSED with these and the pretty little glass jar they came in, so dainty and elegant!",1
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!",1
The ear pins are very unusual.I love them and they were worth the wait. I have them on right now.,1
I love them!!!,1
"I gave Ara so much stress for switching address from NY to Japan.
She was so patient and tried so hard to match my needs.
I finally got items while I was in Japan and I was able to give to my sister. And she loves it.  Thank you so much!",1
"Just arrived, in cute little vile to keep them safe. Good quality earrings, slightly fiddley to get them in at first but once got the hang of them all fine, thank you xx xx",1
I've been looking for ear climbers for a while and these are perfect!,1
"My package arrived today and it's exactly what I expected!! The earrings are easy to put in. While they represent the moon, they are also perfect for the upcoming North American solar eclipse. Thank you!!!",1
"Omg.... these earrings are so unique, i couldn't be happier@",1
These ear climbers are absolutely beautiful. And I can tell that they're quality. Thanks! :),1
Love them!,1
"Love these earrings! I am a science nerd, so they are perfect!",1
I absolutely adore this shop. I‚Äôve ordered several times (because I‚Äôm prone to always and forever losing my earrings lol) and I would highly recommend them.,1
What beautiful earrings! They look lovely on and are just the perfect size. I loved the little glass bottle they came in too! I'm already planning a second order. :),1
Just got these. 5 stars alone for packaging in an adorable little glass bottle; perfect as I always seem to lose one earring. Other sellers should take note on their packaging! Earrings look just as advertised.,1
THESE ARE MY NEW FAVORITE EARRINGS IN THE WHOLE WORLD OMG,1
"I get so many compliments on these earrings. I love that I can bend the silver to the shape of my ear. I ordered the ones with moonstone, and it‚Äôs a beautiful touch",1

"They are perfect!! I absolutely love them, plus very well packaged and cutely, good seller communication and shipping good as well.",1

"Beautiful! Thank you, it's perfect!",1
PERFECT!!!!!  Exactly what I wanted!!!!!  The short wait for production was well worth it and the gift packaging is VERY cute!,1
"The earrings are well worth the wait! They are just lovely. My only small issue: one back wire was somewhat rough. I was able to scratch off some silver ""splinters"" that stuck out with my fingernail, but this hasn't proven a problem at all, even with daily wear.",1
I love them. These are my first ear climbers and I'll doubt they will be the last. Thanks!,1
Another beautiful set of earrings. I love the moon theme. These are also well made and stay put on my ear.,1

"I love these so much, cannot wait to wear them. Gorgeous cute little bottled packaging too!",1
I love the earrings worth the wait,1
I love everything about these ear-rings. Very cute and a perfect size. Love them x,1
These climbers came promptly and have been admired every time I have worn them. I made a very slight adjustment to the end of the wire at the back to make them more comfortable and easier to put on. They came very safely packaged and in a beautiful little jar which would make them a very special gift (in this case for me!),1
Earrings are perfect! They are a little hard to put on but once you figure it out they are so cute! I've gotten tons of compliments.,1
"Very elegant and also fun. Great quality! I'll be wearing this for a long time. :>
Shipping was prompt, and the package arrived from overseas faster than I had hoped.",1
"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it.",1
I love the style of this ear climber.  My lobes are rather small so I have had difficulty getting them to stay put.  They are lovely and I will continue to work with them to get them to sit correctly.  The items arrived in good time and well packaged.,1
"I love them! Was surprised at how ‚Äústurdy‚Äù they seem, I think they will last a long time",1

"Shipping was a bit of a disaster, through no fault of the seller though. Once it reached the country of destination, I stopped getting updates. In total, it took about four weeks for the item to arrive. 

The item itself is really cute. They stay on really well and look really great! I would purchase this item again.",1
"These are lovely, and I'm very happy with them. Thank you so much.",1
I like them very much but the earrings took forever (well over 6 weeks) to arrive inspite of the warning that she was away. When I contacted her about tracking them she said tracking was my issue. So no tracking process was in place from her end.,1

Broke after the first wear. Super disappointed.,0
Item is as described but came out more expensive than I realized due to conversions. The original posting was in USD I believe - not sure I would have spent this much had I known.,0
Easy to put on and comfortable. The earring stays in place.,1
I ordered these earrings  back in October and have not recieved them.  I contacted the seller to inquire and was told that something went wrong with everything in that shipment and they hope I recieve the item I purchased. I replied asking what my options are over a week ago and the seller has yet to respond. I would like to cancel/ refund for the purchase but im not sure how when the seller won't respond back,0
"I have, to date, still not even received my order.  When I inquired with the shop I was told they can do nothing and to contact the post office.  The post office has nothing.  I'm at a loss here.  I paid my money and did not receive anything for it.  I wish I were able to say something good here and I'm truly disappointed I did not get my order.  When I asked about a refund I was again told to check with the post office.  Next step, formal complaint with Etsy.",0

These earrings are just as beautiful as you imagine them to be!,1
"These are very nice & more on the dainty side than some ""crawler"" style earrings which is great for someone with small ears like myself. I did struggle to get them in at first with the unique angle of the post but once in they were light & comfortable to wear. Also the gold plating is a nicer more natural gold look than a lot of costume jewelry I've received from other sellers on this site.",1
"These are so beautiful and elegant and very sweet, I will wear them often and with everything!  I received them quickly after ordering.",1

Fits my earlobe but not my upper ear,0
"Customer service is very terrible. I contacted regarding a return and I never got a reply. Moreover, the earrings are mismatched, poor quality and it is not Nickle free as claimed. These earrings are as cheap as once you can get for $5.",0
This set is beautiful!! I got the right ear climber and the left as the standard earring. I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! The ear climber cuff/clip has this thing in the back to help tighten it to the desired fit which is awesome. It also came with a Swarovski Crystal ID number which was super nice. Do not hesitate to buy!! If I could put pictures of both earrings on I would but I only seem to be able to upload one so the picture is of the rose gold ear climber!!,0
"I want to start off by saying these earrings are gorgeous, exactly as described/photographed. 

Unfortunately, there were two major downsides: 
#1) They took 5 weeks to get here and while the seller was accommodating and sympathetic to my pre-wedding freak out, I was genuinely surprised at the length of time and was my ONLY overseas Etsy purchase that took that long (everything else was 2-3 weeks). 
#2) They were extremely uncomfortable and I had to pull them off almost immediately due to painful pinching. I thought maybe I had them on wrong and had two of my bridesmaids check them...nope, on correctly. Not sure what the deal was there, I don‚Äôt have robust ears by any means and they just hurt. Really a bummer to spend this much money and not be able to ever wear them, let alone for the purpose I purchased them.",0
"I have been looking for earrings for my bridesmaids.  It's been hard to find something that fits my ""vision.""  I came across Rebekas page and absolutely fell in love with her designs!  I found these earring just in hopes they would work.  They took a few weeks to come in, but TOTALLY worth the wait!  Nothing was damaged, and they were packed with care.  When I opened the box that held the earrings I melted!  They look even better than the pictures!  I took them outside in the natural sunlight, and all I can say is ""WOW!""  Now that I know they are EXACTLY what I am looking for...I will be ordering 3 more for the remaining bridesmaids!  Her work is beautiful and detailed.  Truly, some of the most beautiful pieces of jewelry I have seen in a long time!  THANK YOU!!!!",1
These earrings were absolutely stunning. Well worth the money. I wore them on my wedding day and they matched my dress perfectly and looked and felt expensive. Photographed well and I got lots of compliments!,1
"Once again, Rebekas work was AMAZING!  I did end up purchasing 3 other large pairs for my bridesmaids...and I also needed something for my junior bridesmaid.  She made the earrings for my junior bridesmaid 100% IDENTICAL to my bridesmaid, just in a smaller size. and in a clip on since she does not have pierced ears. 
 Shipping was very quick.  Seriously, I cannot wait to recommend her to other friends and family member for special events in the future.  PLEASE SUPPORT HER BUSINESS!",1
Rebeka was so helpful and worked with me to meld two of her signature pieces into my very own earring. They are so perfect! Exactly what I wanted-great quality. Can‚Äôt wait to wear them on my big day. It‚Äôs the perfect blend of elegance and my personality! Thank you thank you!!,1
"Love this Carnelian ring which Rebeka made for me. Carnelian is my birth stone and is associated with vitality, motivation and success. I searched several shops before choosing Rebeka Jewelry. The simple and minimal design style for this historically ancient gemstone suits me best for this ring. Very friendly experience to correspond in Israel with her! Happy. :)",1
These are BEAUTIFUL! I bought them for my wedding because I wanted a pop of color but struggled finding something that didn't look cheap.  These were absolutely perfect and the perfect size!,1
I love my new ring!! I asked for a pink opal and it‚Äôs beautiful especially in the sun. Excellent quality and workmanship. The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. It‚Äôs very elegant and sparkling. It took 20 days to receive it but it is worth the wait. I will be shopping here again.,1
The jewelry I ordered was more beautiful in person and I couldn‚Äôt be happier to wear it on my wedding day,1
Hey! I got my jewelleries from Rebeka and I have to say I feel like a Queen now! She did just what I wanted. When I opened my boxes and saw the sparkle and shine from the jewelleries I couldnt believe my eyes. Thank you Rebekaüíù,1
"This was a custom order. As a return customer, Rebecca worked with me on an idea of different colored stones around the sides.  The result was more lovelier than I could have imaged and I am happily wearing them today!",0

"These are so cool looking, I can‚Äôt wait to wear them!! They are a little on the heavy side so I probably will wear them only for the reception (not the ceremony) but they are going to look SO GOOD with my leather jacket! Just an FYI these are glamorous enough that you probably don‚Äôt need a necklace with them!",1
Beautiful craftsmanship! Simple and elegant. I‚Äôm very happy with this piece!,1

"Absolutely stunning, even better in person! They arrived really quickly, too. Thank you!",1
"These earrings are beautiful and elegant! They are versatile and can be worn from casual to very dressy. They‚Äôre bold, but definitely not gaudy. In addition, they‚Äôre comfortable to wear. I purchased the rose gold/tone color. The color is not a deep rose gold-tone color. It is more of the color of genuine rose gold. I compared it to a genuine rose gold ring that I have. The color might not be as visible in the picture; But, it is a little more visible in person and in the reflection of light.",0
gorgeous! looks great as a pair (one on each ear) and looks great with the crawler on one ear depending on the hairdo- very very happy with the purchase of both!!!!!!!,1

"The necklace itself is beautiful. The corrected matching earrings I received as a gift for my wedding are beautiful as well. 
UPDATED REVIEW: The customer service is something less than desirable, it was not until after my initial review that she offered to pay for the return shipping for a manufacturing error that was originally on her end. However, Rebeka did pay back the return shipping & gave me a discount code for a future purchase.",0

I will never order again to this seller and recommend everyone to avoid this shop",0

"Great quality and fast shipping, thank you.",1
These earrings are beautiful. I will definitely purchase again from this shop!,1
"The item was okay, however, the picture is very misleading. The description matches the earings(the size of the stone), but the picture gives a different image of the item. For instance, in the sellers' image, the stone looks round, full, with vivid colors. In reality, this is not exactly the case. For one, the stones don't look the same. One stone is rounded and the other is not.  When I opened the box I was disappointed. Still, the earrings look good, but they didn't live up to my expectations.  The package was shipped on time. Everything else is okay, I guess.",0
Stunning jewelry and great service!,1
"It finally arrived and is very beautiful, however it is not the size ordered. It is three sizes too small. Disappointing.",0

good but a bit uncomfortably tight on the ears,1
"It was packaged nice and was delivered to me in a timely manner. The 925 Silver is shiny and very beautiful. However, I do think that these specific ones don't compliment my ear shape very well. They also would slide off my ear occasionally throughout my day when I would wear them. *5 stars for the fast shipping, reasonable prices, and secure packaging. Definitely looking forward to trying out some other styles of earrings and ear climbers from this shop in the future.",1
Looove them!!,1
Love these ear climbers they are my first pair definitely will be purchasing more! Great company got my item quickly and exactly what I wanted!,1
"I don't wear earrings a lot.  Due to my job requiring me to be on the phone almost 80% of my day, they are uncomfortable.  But these, are exactly what I needed!  I've gotten a lot of compliments on them!",1

These earrings feel sturdy and well-made while at the same time being delicate and minimalist. I've never worn ear-crawlers before so it took me a day or two to figure out what was comfortable. I was able to bend the back slightly to fit to my ear, and now it's been in place for a couple of weeks. I am very happy with this and it's exactly what I've been looking for.",1

I love them. ‚ù§Ô∏è,1

"I LOVED these earrings as soon as I saw them, and was disappointed that they broke the first time I tried to wear them. I contacted Claudia and she immediately sent a replacement pair. I've been wearing them for over a month now, and I love them! They are so unique and beautiful. 
Claudia - Thank you so much for your prompt response, wonderful customer service, and lovely item. I look forward to shopping on your site in the future! :)",1

Wie sie im Dauerbetrieb funktionieren, wei√ü ich n.n., da ich sie n.n.so lange trage. LG AnnA",1
"I love these earrings so much! They arrived earlier than I expected, which was a plus because I wanted to wear them straight away! I've been wavering about purchasing them for a while and I'm so glad I finally did! I wear them in my second piercing while I wear my starbursts in my first and I feel so cosmic when I do! These are great and just as cute as expected.",1

"These are so cute! Exactly as pictured, and the seller is wonderful... she let me know there would be a shipping delay due to covid, and included an extra little gift because of that. Will absolutely order from this shop again :)",1
"These are pretty. They are costume jewelry and have that look to them. They arrived quickly. The seller was great! I just expected the stones to look more real than they ended up looking. I think the phrase ""genuine vintage opal"" in the title was a bit misleading. The stones are noticeably glass. I like them, but I wouldn't have bought them had I realized. I don't think this was intentional on the sellers part.",0

Beautifully made and super easy to put on. Just love these. Thank you!,1
"coole Ohrklemmen (ich wu√üte nicht mal das es sowas gibt). Ich k√∂nnte mir vorstellen, das es als Ohrstecker noch besser h√§lt? Bei meinen Ohren verrutschen sie gelegentlich. St√∂rt mich aber nicht, ich habe mir noch mehr bestellt :-)",0
"I received this and the other two items quickly (considering the trip from Germany to the US) and they all came beautifully packaged in individual boxes.  Each item is clearly well made and I‚Äôve enjoyed mixing them into my daily jewelry routine.  Sharing the name of this artist with others, and looking forward to buying more in the future!",1

I will need to adjust the backs with pliers in order to make them fit well. Could just be my ears though.
Would definitely recommend if you're looking for unique earrings.",1

Swift shipping and very delicate and beautiful earrings! The only downside is that I have to adjust the position of the earrings a few times during the day but so far at least they've never fallen out.,1

Item is exactly what is pictured & good quality.,1
"When these earrings came in, they had the wrong backs, which meant I couldn't wear them like they were made. I emailed Villa Sorgenrei just to inquire about it and not only did they send me a new pair with the correct backs (and did not have me send the wrong ones back), they also sent me another pair of earrings as a gift for dealing with the mistake! They had tremendous customer care, take so much pride in their products and work, and really do make beautiful jewelry! I will most definitely be ordering from them again soon!",0

very dainty and lovely.  arrived quickly,1
I like the look but they don't work well for me personally due to my thinner earlobes.,1
"Lovely earrings, a little bigger than expected but still very cute and recipient will love.",1
"These are my first pair of ""climber"" earrings, and they can be a bit uncomfortable to tighten against the back of my ear, but I love the earring design. Only request is whether the jeweler can find any creative ways to make the closure more comfortable in the back?",1
Beautiful earrings and the shipment was fast!,1
These are just as described and beautiful.  I love them.,1
"Just beautiful!  Fast shipping, no hassles...",1
Thank you so much!  Lovely earrings:),1

Beautiful earrings. Fast shipping!!!,1
Beautiful earrings! My daughter loves them. Thank you!,1
"these earrings are beautiful,  but the design is awkward, with a long brace to hold them in the back.  they are uncomfortable and constantly slip down.   Seems that a regular post with the plastic disk around it, designed for heavier/larger earrings, would work better.  Also the opal is mounted on a thick silver disk, so from the front you can see it.  It would look better if the side of the opal were flush with the ear.   I also wonder if these have nickel in them since I have a slight reaction to the metal.  Hopefully the artist will take this as constructive feedback to improve the wearability.",0
Lovely earrings and quick delivery. Earrings larger than expected but they are still lovely...,1
Love these. Had to pinch them a little bit because one fell out of my ear. Now I just slide it slightly tightened over my ear.,1
A gift again I love them,1

"Subject:My only and last order from this company!

Date:

1 day ago8:02am EDT

Message:Good morning,
I wore this pair of earrings one time since I received them. The second time I attempted to wear them one of the earrings broke. I wasn't expecting a problem with these earrings so I discarded the packaging (especially since I sent a message that I thought I received a smaller size than what is represented on the website). How can I return these defective earrings? I have decided to shop elsewhere for my jewelry needs.
Tonya Goode",0
"I‚Äòm in love with these earringsüòçThey are so adorable. And I‚Äòm really happy that they have 2 holes, so I can choose the length of the pendants and so they fit nicely on the earlobe.",1
"Gorgeous!! I was worried these beauties would not fit my ear shape very well because I don‚Äôt have very rounded earlobes... but I wanted to take the chance because I love the classy, minimalist look of them. They look GREAT! Take a chance, you prob love them too! Shipping was super fast, even though it was international. And the owner of the shop is so kind and gives great customer service! Gracias!!!",1
Looove!,1
"I received the Silver ball ear jacket earrings.  They are very well made and sturdy.  The posts were fine, not too thick.  And something else noteworthy is that the back part where the balls hang is adjustable.  So if you're piercing hole is closer to the bottom of your ear lobe, you can adjust the back part so it doesn't hang too low.  Beautiful!!",0
I love these earrings so much! So cute and dainty but still makes a statemetnt and the quality is great for the price! Will be buying more!,1
ABSOLUTELY LUV luv luv... these earrings ‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíô,1
"LOVE these earrings and I get so many compliments everywhere I go, beautiful work,  thank you so much!",1
Me han encantado!! han llegado el pedido perfecto y con mucha rapidez! Repetir√©!!,1
"I love these earrings so much that I repierced my ears to wear them! The quality is fantastic and they‚Äôre even cuter than I had hoped. Plus they are surprisingly comfortable.

Will be purchasing many more items from this shop!",1
I love these earrings! I was a bit hesitant to buy them as I was worried they wouldn‚Äôt fit my ears (the jacket would be too large and hang lower than my ear lobe) but they fit perfectly. It has two holes on the jacket so you can adjust it to make sure they fit your ears well.,1
These have quickly become my very favorite earrings. I cannot believe how many people ask me about them and compliment how lovely and unusual they are. They shipped quickly and were beautifully packaged.,1
I love these and always get compliments and questions about where I got them,1
"Sooooo happy with these earrings. Very unique and suit me so well!
Thanks!",1
The earrings are very pretty and true to the picture. They stay steady in your ears throught the whole day and the great thing is that they're adjustable and interchangeable,1
Love these earrings so much bought 2 pairs. Top quality. Perfect overseas shipping. My new favorite for earrings. Thanks so very much.,1
"Absolutely love these earrings! Dainty stylish, perfect for work or evening out.",1
These are really cool and unique! I love the earring jacket look! It is like having the impact of several piercings in one piece! Again with this style I could use an additional option for shortening the earrings tighter to my lobes. This is probably my own problem because my first piercings are so stretched out from little kids yanking on them in my youth! Very cool though!,1
Gracias he recibido mi orden y es exactamente lo que esperaba!!!,1
"I love the earrings, fast delivery and the customer service was wonderful. Very easy to talk to and so friendly!",1

I was very pleased that today in the afternoon the package did appear with my US mail. So if you are buying from the US don‚Äôt worry if the package doesn‚Äôt arrive on the day it says it will be delivered. The earrings are beautiful and I can‚Äôt wait to wear them! Thank you for the great customer service.",1

I do wish they were a little more curved/circular because they look more like a line under my lobe from certain angles,  but that could just be that my ear lobe is smaller than most.",1

I received the earrings very quickly with in a view workingdays.

The only thing is that te back of the earrings goes loose, whereby the risk of loosing the earring is a bit bigger.",1
I received my item damaged. I got a refund back on the item but not shipping. I don‚Äôt understand why I have to pay for a damaged item.,0
"These are super cute, fit nicely, are easy to use, and got lots of compliments! The packing was safe, and the shipping was very fast. When I had a question about the item, the store owner replied very promptly. Be advised that the two ""jacket"" sections are textured on the same side (not mirror-images of each other), so when you flip one to wear it, they are slightly different. Also, the earrings I received look more like gold cylinders (about 3mm high) rather than the dimpled, button-like ones in the photo. This was totally fine for me, and I am very happy with my purchase, but if you have questions about the set, just ask the seller! She's very friendly and quick to get back with you. Overall, I love this set and feel pretty wearing it. :)",1
"These are so fun!! They are definitely big which means they don't pair easily with other large earrings, but if you're buying them to be the statement piece (which is what I did), then they are perfection! Definitely my current favorite earrings! And easy to use with a mask!",1
"I love these earrings and had a great experience with the artist, Suzy. I already purchased these in silver and loved them so much I ordered in gold. When they arrived the back on one earring was a little loose and ended up falling off somewhere within just a couple hours. :( I reached out to Suzy and almost immediately she responded saying sorry for the inconvenience and she‚Äôd send me a new one. Very happy with the earrings and customer service!",1

These are very cute! You have 3 earrings in one. You can wear the studs or add a flair with the petals!,1
"The earrings are beautiful and I have gotten compliments already. My only lament is that the pattern is not symmetrical and I didn't get mirrored earrings they are the same ""side"" so in order to wear them in a mirrored way, the finish on one is the backside. Not highly noticeable, but would've been 5 stars if it was.",0
beautiful work! my mother loved the earrings and thought they were so unique!,1
"Love these! Have received a lot of compliments on the unique design. The post and circle appears to be a slightly different email material than the petals, but not noticeable from anyone else's perspective.",1

Such a cute design. But they don‚Äôt come as shown. You don‚Äôt get the simple circle post earring. What does come left my ear green. Low quality ü§®bummed!,0
"Cute earrings, although I was charged shipping upon delivery as well as shipping when I paid for the item.",1
Not what I was expecting and it‚Äôs a 3 piece earring. However not all parts stay well on the bar.,0
"Earrings were cute, however when I received them the USPS man came to my doorstep and charged me additionally (from what I had already been charged when I paid for them) because the sender did not pay enough for the postage. I was very upset so I will not be ordering from this shop in the future. From the looks of the other reviews it seems like I‚Äôm not the first to have a problem with this shop.",0
Deceitful. heavy overcharge on shipping-upon receiving standard no. 10 envelope and 49 cents stamp contacted shop no refund/ no answer/no explanation.,0

"I was worried that these would look too crazy to wear to the office, but they are the perfect mix of modern and work-appropriate.",1

Absolutely love these earrings!! They're exactly what I was looking for. They're beautiful and super comfy!,1
I love my new earrings!,1
"These earrings are awesome. I have wanted a pair of ear jackets since I saw a girl wearing them on an airplane a year ago. And, major bonus - I am not allergic to them! I have an unknown metal allergy that random earrings will provoke, but nothing from these, so happy. Will definitely order again!",1
"Update: The shop reached out to me and offered to change the ear jackets with a custom pair that works for me. They are super cute and I am thrilled with the customer service. I now have several pairs of earrings from this shop; they are all of excellent quality and work well even for my sensitive ears.

These are super cute but unfortunately, the sunburst spokes on the jacket portion are too short to be seen behind my earlobes. It ends up looking more like you can see the back of an earring that you shouldn't than the style. They do seem to be well made and would be cute if the sizing worked better for me. I haven't decided yet if I will try to give them to a friend for whom they might work better or just wear the bar studs alone, which would be fine.",1
"Super fast shipping, wonderful earrings. I love that they come with both the stud and the ear jacket as a set. They're very unique and high-quality, I highly recommend them.",1
I think these earrings are so cool! They arrived at my house on time also! I will be buying more from this shop.,1
"These earrings were just what I was looking for and they didn‚Äôt bother my sensitive skin! Super cute. Also, I decided I didn‚Äôt like the matte finish and the shops owner had no issue with replacing these with the shiny finish as long as I paid for shipping which was fantastic!",1
Love my earrings!! I got them on time and they came in a cute little box!!,1
great design & quick shipping! everyone compliments the earrings when I wear them :-),1
I love the quality and design of these earrings but they were described as sparkly and they aren't. I was hoping to be able to use them formally but they would be fancier in shiny!,1

"I'm MF obsessed with these earrings. They are so comfortable that I actually don't take them out. I sleep in them, work out in them etc. #alwaystrendy",1
"Love, love, love these ear jackets. Got a ton of compliments on how different and cool they were the first day I wore them! Only problem I have is that my ear lobe was torn when I was younger and the bar tends to slip through it from time to time. Not the earrings fault just something to be aware of if your ears have larger holes too.",1
Loved theses so much after I got myself a pair that I had to get a friend a pair too!,1

"It is shine and beautiful, the gift box well-made with good quality!  I have a long hair it looks cool with... My husband loves this earring. It looks natural and cute.",1
These earrings are precious! I love that they are small enough to be appropriate for an 11 yr old but still have enough detail to get noticed. The receiver and I both love the 3D effect and finish of the silver. Also I ordered them later than I should‚Äôve and didn‚Äôt even consider they might arrive on time. But they shipped very quickly and they were here in time for the birthday girl‚Äôs party.,1
Shipping took FOREVER but not at all the sellers fault! Earrings are adorable and well made. My daughter put them on right away. She has multiple ear piercings and used the second holes for these. They look cute! Thank you!!!,1
"I really love these, they are super subtle even though they're faceted. High quality materials that keep my ears from swelling up when I wear them. Thanks!",1
I love these so much. So glad I grabbed them. They're going to be my new go-to earrings for everyday. Thank you.,1
Beautiful earrings. The only reason that it didn't get 5 stars is that it didn't include a back. It included a small rubber stopper. Love the earrings and will add my own SS back,1
The earrings are lovely. I‚Äôm allergic to nickel so happy to find some silver earrings with hypoallergenic posts. They shipped very quickly too.,1
I bought these beautiful butterfly earrings for one of my granddaughters.  They were absolutely perfect.  They arrived quickly and were boxed perfectly for a Christmas present.,1
So pretty and exactly as pictured! Very satisfied and will be purchasing from this shop again! I received the earrings later than expected but the buyer put a bonus set of earrings for the delay of shipping! Absolutely love the bonus earrings! I also loved the packaging!,1
"I'm in love with these earrings. They're exactly what I was looking for. They are extremely comfortable - in fact I haven't taken them off since I got them! I don't even know they're there. I love hoop earrings, but my long hair gets tangled in them. These dangles with star climbers are the perfect antidote!",1
Absolutely beautiful. My daughter loved them!  Thanks for getting them here well in advance of the holiday!,1
I am in love with these earrings. The customer service is superb!,1
"These earrings are simply stunning and I bought six pairs for gifts with one of those being for me.  The shipping took a long time, so that's the only reason that I didn't award FIVE STARS.  However, these ran on special on Black Friday, so I'm sure that Sharon was inundated with orders.  I'm also taking into account that the online sales volume was huge this season, so the mailing was delayed as well.  She was a great communicator and her designs are really special.  I'll be ordering from her again.",1
So pretty! These earring are so cute and just the perfect size. Loved them!,1
LOVE IT! Especially the fast shipping,1

"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!",1
"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne",1
Quality! It's so well done. Pretty! Delivered well within time. Love the wood on which it was pierced into as well. Great job Laura!,1
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.,1
"I am so delighted with these beautiful ear jackets! Love the delicate details and craftsmanship. The slice of wood that the earrings came packaged in was a creative, rustic touch. Already eyeing additional stud earrings to mix and match with the jackets - thank you!!",1
The earrings were exactly as pictured and excellent quality.  They were beautifully and creatively packaged.  I was amazed how quickly they arrived from overseas.,1
Love these little earrings! Have had many compliments on them.  Took a little while to get here from Lithuania but worth it!,1
Absolutely stunning earrings!,1
Beautiful!,1

You won't regret buying these earring jackets... I love them. They are small but if you have short hair they are perfect!  I will be back for more!,1

These are really beautiful earrings. Love wearing them with different fronts.,1
My girlfriend loves these - thank you!,1
Very pretty ear ring.  My only complaint is that it is quite delicate and smaller than expected.  I have long thick hair and need a bolder ear ring.,1
Item BETTER than described. Fast shipping. Thank you!,1
Love these! Thank you for the upgrade to a better material! I will probably be a repeat customer in the near future :),1
"The x is much smaller than the picture suggests. It‚Äôs maybe the size of a pencil eraser. It‚Äôs kind of hard to see. Maybe these models just have tiny faces and ears, but i was expecting the earrings to be larger.",0
"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them.""",1
"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke...",0
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!",1

Beautiful piece of jewelry...I love it!,1
"So simple! The others I've seen around are bigger, I prefer the subtleness of these. They don't irritate my sensitive ears either. This is my second pair. I lost my first pair on the first time I took them out after 3 months straight of wearing.",1
Perfect and lovely thank you!!!,1
"Vackra smycken, tack och m√•nga h√§lsningar fr√•n Tyskland! <3",0

Good work and timings. Thank you,1
Beautiful minimalist earrings. I'm a returning customer and I guess that says everything.,1
I like them very much!  I already wear them!,1
Unfortunately it looks like u have a grin on your earlobe. Not at all lika u would think a climber earing.,0
"I bought multiple pairs of ear climbers because I wasn't sure what I wanted. Others from different shops were uncomfortable, pinched my ears, fell off, or just didn't sit right. These are PERFECT and I couldn't be happier!",0
"I got the gold and gold, and I love it! It‚Äôs very lightweight and comfortable, and I forget I have it in. 10/10 recommend.",1
These earrings are amazing! The beadwork stays in place - no risk of losing a bead from the set. Love them!! And the shop owner is super responsive if you have any questions.,1
"Beautiful! They‚Äôre exactly what I wanted, I‚Äôm so happy with them. Thank you!",1
Seller was very helpful! The ear climbers are beautiful!! :),1

"Alles super! Vielen Dank! Bin sehr zufrieden, der Schmuck sieht sehr sch√∂n aus!",0

Love ‚ù§Ô∏è,1

"Perfect! The mini is also an awesome size for those of us with small, thin earlobes. Totally love it.",1
"These are super cute - they were a tiny bit wider than I anticipated but not significantly. Since these were my first pair of ear crawlers it took me a few times to get the hang of putting them in, but I've gotten better at it each time. I've gotten so many compliments on these.. wish I had bought more :)",1

"The post on the earring gets bent and misshapen quickly -- it's ok, the earring still works, but something to keep in mind. I also find these earrings irritate my ears...perhaps something in the metal amalgam. Otherwise, they have a great, simple look.",1
Beautiful earrings! I've gotten lots of compliments and I just recently got them!,1

Loved both the silver and the gold,1
Arrived beautifully wrapped. Good quality and they look great! Thanks!,1
"I love these earrings!  They are very well made. Contrary to some other reviews, you do not need to bend the earring in order to insert it into your ear; you just need to twist it around to get into place.",0
"Nice earrings. Didn't fit my ear well. Gave them to my gf. Fit hers fine. (I'm also a girl, btw)",1
Love these! So cute.,1
Great quality and fast shipping!!,1
Love my earrings! Sure cute and shipped really fast!,1
"They look exactly like the pictures, and the rose gold color is really nice! The only thing I would have liked to know is that you have to bend the back of the earring to get it on. It would have been better if it was on a hinge so that the metal doesn't wear out over time. Love the look regardless!",1
"Beautiful, came just as expected.",1
Fit nice and shipped quickly!,1
Item is as pictured and shipping was fast! Love it!,1
"Really cute! Only had them for a day, but I know I can wear them with anything! :)",1
Simple elegant design. Have received many compliments. :),1
"Absolutely loved them. Found them to be too loose and moved easily on my ears when I put them in yesterday. So I moved them to angle higher on my ear and pinched them to try to make tighter. Went to grocery store, got back in the car, looked in mirror... one missingüò¢",0
Love these earrings! Very simple way to feel more put together.,1

"Beautiful and fast shipping, thank you! Will buy again :-)",1
This item is beautiful. I bought it partially because it looked sturdy as if it would be comfortable enough to sleep in but secure enough to stay in. After three days it fell out and is nowhere to be found. I was very excited about the idea of this item and would like to order another but I'm too afraid of it falling out again. It is high quality and solid.,0
Given as a gift and they loved it!!!!,1

"I LOVE these ear jackets!  As soon as they arrived, I switched out what I was wearing for these, and I've barely taken them off since!  They are very well made, and I just love the look.  I measured my ears to ensure these would fit (well, I had a helper).  They sometimes fit a little longer than pictured, but if I push the bottom against my ear, they look as pictured.  Either way is great - don't hesitate!  Virginia, thanks for making these for me!",1
"I absolutely love Virginia's designs - they are simple, elegant, striking, and unique all at once. I purchased several pairs of earrings because I just couldn't pick a favorite. I cannot wear any of them without getting compliments. I'm sure I'll treat myself with more her beautiful pieces in the future and will recommend this shop to anyone who asks in the meantime. Thanks so much!",1
Fab!,1
"I have always hated jacket earrings...until I saw these!!!  So cute, such simple design, clever, and modern.  I love them!!",1

Lovely medusa jewelry that came in a gorgeous little box. I accidentally pulled it out when I stupidly opened a can of pop with my teeth but it gave me a prompt excuse to order two more.

The clicker almost locks in place and is very difficult to undo so you can change out the jewelry. It is slightly painful to remove because of this.,0
"This is the earring I wear on a day to day basis, its really comfortable and I've had quite a few compliments on it as well.",1
I was very very happy with this order at first. I have only been wearing this hoop for about one month and it had turned from gold to completely silver in color. It‚Äôs very well made and the perfect size and fit but I am disappointed that it is no longer gold. So my search continues.,0

"I‚Äôve been looking for rings that I can take in and out easily for work. So a clasp has been desired. However, I only got to wear this about 5 times before the clasp broke. I tried to fix it but the hinge bar would not stay in. I guess that comes with the nature of something so small and delicate. I loved the design and the quality of the metal seemed fine.",0

"I cannot express how supremely satisfied and thrilled I am with Anja‚Äôs professionalism, responsiveness, courtesy, and the product itself! 
The anklet is a beautiful piece of work with unparalleled attention to detail. I especially love the clasp. It takes some getting used to but is strong and reliable. It was very thoughtful of her to have made the bells removable because sometimes I wish to wear them and sometimes not. I especially love that the size is customizable‚Äî something not available with other sellers. 
The packaging was neat and a pleasure to unpack! Order date July 15 (afternoon), received July 30. 

Overall, no one and no other product could possibly compete! I will certainly be ordering more.

"Der Ring ist wundersch√∂n. Ich habe ihn jetzt schon knapp zwei Wochen jeden Tag getragen. Die Gr√∂√üe l√§sst sich wunderbar nachjustieren, dass hei√üt, auch wenn die Finger mal dicker oder d√ºnner sind, kann man den Ring immer bequem tragen. Anfangs dachte ich, der Ring sei zu gro√ü, aber man konnte ihn leicht zusammenbiegen, so das er perfekt sitzt.
Der Ring kommt in einer wundersch√∂nen kleinen Box. Er ist nachhaltig verpackt und dazu hat man eine sch√∂ne Aufbewahrung f√ºr den Ring. Ich liebe solche Details, wenn man sieht, mit wie viel Liebe da jemand Sachen verkauft.
Au√üerdem bekommt man noch ein kleines Heftchen, wo Pflegetipps stehen. 
Ich bin auf jeden Fall sehr happy, dass ich diesen Ring ausgew√§hlt habe, und kann es jedem nur empfehlen!",1

"Zuerst mal: Eine wahnsinnig schnelle Lieferung - sonntags bestellt und Dienstag geliefert. Das ist mal absolute Spitzenklasse - wie √ºberhaupt der ganze Kontakt; schnell, kompetent, richtig individuell und einfach wunderbar herzlich.

Und der Zehenring?
Sitzt perfekt, sieht klasse aus und f√ºhlt sich super an - nach kurzer Zeit merkt man ihn gar nicht mehr - ein toller Hingucker gerade jetzt in der k√ºhleren Zeit, wo F√º√üe ohne Schuhe drau√üen ohnehin schon mehr auffallen.
Auch super: der Lieferung sind ein Reinigungstuch sowie eine ausf√ºhrliche Pflegeanleitung beigelegt.

Das war jetzt mein zweiter Zehenring von LYD und da hatte sie einen neuen Pflegetipp eingepackt, weil die allgemeine Anleitung hier ja schon vorliegt.

Lovely earrings and prompt delivery. Thank you!,1
Lovely! Planning to wear at my wedding.,1
BEAUTIFUL earrings! I love these earrings so much! I wore them in my wedding and received so many compliments.  The sparkles were gorgeous. I technically didn't wear them as intended with the climbing style because I realized that personally I have pretty small ears and when I put them on as so the earrings kind of flared out. So I switched sides with the earrings and allowed them to hang down. They were beyond expectations and SO beautiful. I would highly recommend these earrings and shop to anyone looking for the perfect amount of sparkle and beauty!,1
"I absolutely love this earrings!!! The crystals are sparkling so beautifuly and they're really stylish. They're exactly as I wanted them to be, can't wait to wear them on my wedding day! It's a really special final touch on my outfit for That Day... THANK YOU A LOT!! <3 <3 <3",1

The earings are super pretty and very sturdy it came in time and they look expensive.  My advice is the scroll the little thing on the top so it will adjust to your ear. It came a little tight after loosing up the thing they fit perfectly. Thank you!,1
"Absolutely stunning earings!!! My only complaint: while the clamp style backing on the top of the earing is great for keeping it in place, it is slightly uncomfortable. That said, I'm very happy with this purchase and would definitely buy from this seller again.",1
The earrings are amazing!! I love them. Great quality. I wanted them in silver rather than gold and they were made exactly as I requested.,1
"These are absolutely perfect for my wedding day!  I will have two looks.  I will use them as crawlers with my hair in an updo and I will switch them to be vertical for my half-updo.  I can't wait!  They are gorgeous, thank you!",1
"These earrings are very pretty. I like how strongly the back holds onto the earring. I almost thought I couldn't get it off, but it'll be great to hold these babies up for my wedding. Very nice.",1
The earrings are really lovely! Looks exactly like on the pic even more beautifully!. I am really happy that I chose them. Thank you ! :),1

Beautiful...exactly what the bride wanted to wear on her wedding day,1
Love the earrings. They are absolutely beautiful and classy. Can't wait to wear them at my wedding.,1
Beautiful earrings - the upper cuff on one was angled differently than the other so it was harder to keep it on my ear. Otherwise I received many compliments on the earrings and loved how they looked.,1
Beautiful earrings. Small but with a big statement.,1
Beautiful piece of jewellery but top end isn't flush to my ear - might be because my ears are quite small but they're not any smaller than the model's ears. I'll need to apply facial glue to have them flush to my ears.,0

I can‚Äôt tell you how excited I was to receive the Florida orange perfume bottle.  I have been looking for one for years.  Thank you for the care you took in packaging the bottle arrived in perfect condition.   As a child in the 50s my neighbor and I would get our allowance and go to the 5&dime. We were always lured by the Florida orange perfume in its unique container.  Maybe a long walk down memory lane but I couldn‚Äôt be more thrilled. Our little Florida town hasn‚Äôt changed much except you can no longer find a 5&dime or an orange shaped perfume bottle. Thank you so much for everything!! Sincerely Judy,1

"Not quite what I thought, but still very happy with them. Communication with seller is great also, thank you very much!",
The colour for the rose gold is really different to the picture and they also definitely look longer on the ear than in the photo. Seller said it was okay to return but then had a go at me for saying the two products looks different and didn‚Äôt feel it was fair I cop the shipping costs as it cost me as much as the earrings. Probably wouldn‚Äôt shop here again.,
Some of the wire is a tiny bit rusty but overall very happy with my purchase!,
"Extremely happy with the colour, quality and fit! Has a really nice weight to it and is obviously not made with a cheap, crappy material. Originally got the yellow gold necklace but it wasn't my colour, so I returned it and got the rose gold and it was perfect. Will definitely purchase another item in the future!",

"Scheint nicht aus einem Metallguss zu sein. An dem Teil, das im Ohr sitzt platzt eine Beschichtung ab.

Ich habe echten unbeschichteten Silberschmuck und der ist biegsam. 

Das h√§tte ich bei diesem Produkt auch vorausgesetzt, da ja jede Ohr-Form anders ist und eine Anpassung ben√∂tigt.

H√ºbsch sind die Ohrringe, aber es hilft nichts, wenn man sie nicht an das Ohr anpassen kann, ohne dass sie brechen.

Man zahlt wohl f√ºr das Design nicht das Material.",

"The climbers look great, and seem high quality.

There were some issues with shipping, causing them to take more than 25 days to arrive from the time when I was notified that they were shipped. Not entirely the seller's fault, as the Canadian post went on strike for a while and probably delayed the shipping, but unfortunately they did not arrive in time for Christmas, as they were intended to be a gift.",

I cant stop ordering these! I am blessed to have expensive jewelry and I get more compliments when I wear this bracelet. They are so unique and people just love them!,
"Love my necklace. It's perfect. Definitely get one. Everywhere I go, people ask about it. ü•∞",
I am absolutely thrilled with this! It‚Äôs classy. Simple. Elegant. The chain is almost invisible which spotlights the Swarovski crystal ‚Äúdiamond‚Äù. The stone sparkles! And when on my neck it lays well and does not twist or tangle. I am impressed and I do not impress easily. I will be ordering other pieces.,

"I am so happy with this purchase. Such a unique pair of earrings I have already gotten so many compliments. I also have to give props to the supplier. The holidays came with lots of delays beyond the suppliers control but I was given several updates throughout the delays which made me feel so much more at ease. I did not even have to reach out with questions, they were always one step ahead! Will be purchasing again.",
"Outstanding experience!  Seller was responsive, pleasant and delivered spot-on customer service.  Product (2-piece geometric earrings) were just as described and presented online, plus my wife loved them as well (most important part).  The packaging (pull-tab box with Gold Spoon logo and light blue tie-closure jewelry bag also stamped with company logo) was professional and a nice touch!  I would definitely shop at Gold Spoon again, and recommend to others.  Thanks again for the great experience and outstanding product.",

"I absolutely LOVE this item! I've been looking for a more fun item for my cartilage piercing and j have finally found it. Great material. Very awesome artist too- I goofed and ordered the left earring when I needed the right, and she was so open to the exchange and it was super easy. Thanks Melanie!!",
"I love it!...might want to pierce the left just to wear another one of these. Just a suggestion, maybe a shorter post with a smoother/screw clasp...but still love what I got!",
The package is wonderful and thoughtful. This cartilage earring is by far the best earring i bought. It is not heavy and it looks good. Thank you,
In love with this new piece! Even better in person!! Thank you!,
Looks so cute in my cartilage. Have gotten so many compliments already. Also fast shipping :),
Love everything about this earring - very unique and well crafted!,
"Wish it was bent just a tiny bit more so that it fit my ear a little better, but other than that I love it!",
"Beautiful earring, very well made. I had to send back to get the post moved down to sit better in my ear. Melanie was more than happy to fix my earring. She was fast with applying to message and fast shipping. I will definitely be ordering more jewelry from her",
Love the crawler. Fits ear great!,
"sooo happy with my purchase!! beautiful item, excellent service, and super fast shippment. Cant wait to make business with you again (:",

What a lovely piece of jewelry! It is a lovely and stylish earring that brings a new look to your cartilage area. Love this design and look forward to wearing it.,

"I love the quality, just waiting for my ear to heal to wear this!",
beautifully made piece of art,
Great quality and looks fantastic!,
"This cute little earring shipped quickly and efficiently.  The only reason why I couldn't give it 5 stars was because it doesn't fit my ear like the photo (not the seller's fault) but my cartilage piercing must just be a little lower than the model's causing my arch to not lay flat as shown.  Besides that, it is well made, looks exactly like the photo, and is very sturdy and of good quality.  I have worn it a few times and gotten compliments on it, I just wish it fit my ear as perfectly as in the photo.  ;-)",
Thank u the earrings are soo very cool,
"Fast shipping, great piece of jewelry!",
Love this earring! Only issue is that the back has to be on super tight so it doesn't move.,
"Love it, fits well and looks really cool.",
"Very subtle, so I can get away with wearing it at work. It sticks out just the TINIEST bit, but you can just move it back into place if need be (this mostly happens if you wear the earring to bed or have long hair); otherwise it's great!",
I have worn this every day since I received it. I love it!,
I like this item a lot but it's hard to stay in place,
"Doesn't quite fit in the upper part of my ear like in the picture, but that's my ear, not the earring. The jewelry itself is lovely, and perhaps I'll just buy another and wear them in my lobes instead. üòÑ",
"Article conforme √† la description avec un tr√®s joli packaging, et livr√© tr√®s rapidement.",
I was looking for something new and different - this was perfect!,
Loved the item exactly what was shown and described.,
"Beautiful, unusual piece. Shipped quickly.",
"Great quality and unique piece of jewelry. It fits well into the shape of the ear and does not budge.

The only reason why I give it 4 stars is beacause the piece is actually a lot darker than shown in the pictures. I thought that it was a lot less oxidized than it actually is. It's almost black and not shiny at all. (The flash used in the pictures reflected on the silver made me thought it was)",
Perfect. Thank you so much.,
Got this for my mom for mother's day she loved it! Very well made.,
Very beautiful and very will made.,
Thank you very much! :),
"Exactly as pictured, works great for my cartilage piercing!",
Perfect in every way. Thank you.,
"Very cute, thought it would be a little longer down my ear, seems shorter than the picture shows - but besides that a very nice piece of jewlery. :)",
"a gorgeous earring, thank you",
"Send quickly, 
beautiful, exactly what i expected ! :)",
A+++++++ fast shipper. Item as described.,
"Cute, and I really did love it.  It fit well.  Only problem is that the back was loose and it fell off the first time I wore it and I lost it. :(",
Arrived on time and just as described.,
I did send two emails but got no reply to the second one,
"Love these! Unique, shipped quickly, and I am already getting compliments after wearing for the first time. Love love love!",

So Cute!! Wrapped in a box with a ribbon.  Wonderful!!! Thank you.,
"Very pretty earrings, well made",
"The earrings looked nice and shipped on time.  They're a little bit smaller than I was expecting, but that's my fault for not looking more closely at the measurements.  Just an FYI to anyone else who might have wanted longer crawlers.",
These were so cute! Unfortunately they were too long for my ears (I have child sized ears) and that was my fault for not reading the measurements but they would have been perfect if they fit.,
Wonderful thank you....,
Very nice. Just as pictured.,
"the ear pins are so beautifull in person, very unique design, my sister love them !! shipping was quick and packaging is over the top ;-) would buy again for sure !!",

Emmanuela is SO good at communication, she even was able to tell me a package had been lost before I realized it.  She shipped a new pair immediately and it arrived (in Florida) from Greece in just 3 days.  I would definitely recommend this seller (and artist!) without reservation.  I've just never experienced such prompt communication in probably a hundred transactions!",
"These earrings are even more gorgeous in person! They are comfortable to wear (I've never worn earrings like this before, so I wasn't sure!)! Any time I wear them, I get compliments! Thank you!!!",
"The ear pins are very pretty and give a special look.
They took a little longer in the mail due to the winter storms but I am happy with the purchase.",

Love them!!!,

Love these! All came beautifully wrapped as well. Will be buying more in the future!,
These are dainty and a bit badass at the same time.  They are very light and comfortable.   Delivery was super fast with lovely packaging.  Thank you.,
"Service was amazing! Emmanuela really blew me away by her personal touches and follow up on the order. I am not sure I've ever received such great service from an online sale. The cuff earrings are great, but what was also very impressive was that they came nicely packaged - even with a bag from her shop. It was if I'd just walked out of her store with my purchase :)

Love it and will definitely be buying from her again.",
Fantastic rose gold ear cuff. Beautifully and thoughtfully presented. Quick delivery. A first class seller with an eye for detail. Thank you very much!,

Thank you very much! If needed, you can also message me to confirm my recommendation for the seller. She is incredible person. :)",

The staff all felll in love with the remaining one and I am hoping the lost one will be returned.",
"It got shipped out WAY sooner than promised - a nice surprise! They feel very delicate, I had thought I might wear these quite often (they are very beautiful but I *think* understated enough to do so), but I am afraid of breaking them. One fits my ear better than the other but the directions were very clear and I don‚Äôt think it will be a problem (must be something with me, I imagine, as all bodies are different). Overall very impressed",
beautiful! Just right for the wedding outfit that I wore.,
So beautiful - tons of compliments! Easy to wear and stay put.,
I chose these earrings for my wedding. So beautiful.,
Simply beautiful ! Thanks a lot.,
Honestly really obsessed with these earrings. I was worried they wouldn‚Äôt stay in place or they would be uncomfortable but I was wrong on both accounts. I have pretty sensitive ears and I haven‚Äôt noticed any issues with that either. These are really pretty and I would highly recommend them.,
My daughter wore these on her wedding day and they were stunning! You won‚Äôt be disappointed!,
"These are really beautiful - am planning on wearing for my wedding.  Everything arrived quickly and came with instructions.  They are lightweight without feeling cheap, so I will be able to wear them for the whole day.",
Such a beautiful design! Easy to use and wear.,
Earrings are beautiful! Perfect gift for the holidays,
very pretty and very fast delivery,
Boyfriend loves his new earrings!,
Absolutely gorgeous and unique earrings! So happy with every purchase I've made from this shop. Super helpful and friendly communication :),
I know these say they're for men but I ordered them for myself.  I wear them 5 days out of the week and get so many compliments.  They are the perfect size when you want something basic and fun.,
I'm so impressed with the quality and originality of these earrings. Subtle but makes a statement. My girlfriend loves them and candyfoxx provided such a great customer service experience that I will definitely be buying from her shop in the future.,
"Beautiful piece, and it traveled all the way from Lithuania to US. Worth the wait",
"Nice earrings, finally something else than just round and black. Received the package within one week (Netherlands).",
These are probably my favorite earrings,
Bought these for my boyfriend! Very simple and sleek!,
Love them. Thank you so much.,
"L'article a √©t√© envoy√© tr√®s rapidement, la vendeuse m'a m√™me envoy√© un message pour me dire que le colis √©tait partis.
Les boucles sont superbes, elles paraissent un peu moins √©paisses sur les photos mais rien de d√©rangeant. A achet√© sans h√©sit√©.",
The earrings are larger and made of cheaper quality than expected.,
"The earrings were not entirely what I had expected. The picture maybe have misrepresented the thickness and actual design of the earrings to some extend but that is still generally accetable. What I am displeased would be the use of arcylic paint as it is not entirely water-proof but instead only what resistant, hence the white overlay may come off over time. The use of enamel paint or another water proof paint would have been better. 

Overall an alright product.",
"These earrings are absolutely stunning! Quality craftsmanship and even more gorgeous in person. I am not one to leave reviews, but this earrings were totally worth the wait. I am so delighted with this purchase and this seller! I loved all the little details in the packaging too. It is obvious that the Artikats truly cares about the details from start to finish.",

From the beginning I had some trouble keeping the earnings steady on my ear. However the seller helped me figure out how to make  earnings sit tight on my ear.   The trick was to get it tight at the side where the piercing is. Thank you for your service and some lovely earrings!",
"Very beautiful earrings, looks good, fits perfect. It's no trouble putting them on (I was a bit afraid it should be, but it's not...) I'm very happy with them.",

Beautiful product. Only gave shipping a 1 star because there was such a long delay in receiving the product (this May have been due to Covid-19 disruptions),
"Like someone else mentioned, I didn't know exactly what I was ordering but I LOVE these earrings. There's no back on them. It just twists through and you can't even feel that you're wearing them. And they look unique and very cute.  Nice design! Received 2 weeks from order date.",
I am in love with these! So unique and beautiful. I just received silver today and I am ordering gold today as well! LUV them!,
I love them! Just as pictured/described!,
Simple yet unique design. These are the first earrings I‚Äôve had that didn‚Äôt give me an allergic response. I guess titanium is for those like me who have an allergy to most metals. I‚Äôm elated to have finally found this out after years of irritation and searching. I‚Äôve also showered and slept in them with no issues. Thank you!,
I love the earrings. I have terrible metal allergies and these have been in for over a week with no irritation. They are comfortable to sleep in and I get a lot of compliments. My only complaint is shipping took weeks! If you are good to wait and wait they are a great purchase.,
"I tried to take a picture that shows what the earrings look like in and out. These are awesome! They're super comfy and easy to put in and take off. I even where them to bed and working out. They do take a while from order time to arrival, which is definitely to be expected of such high-quality handmade pieces. Not a criticism! Just something to consider when figuring out when to purchase :)",
"Exactly as advertised, super comfortable and really easy to dress up or dress down!",
Love these. Very unique - get asked about them a lot. Shipping fast.  Earrings are quality work. I ordered titanium to try them out but now I'll order gold. I can even sleep in these which I love. Thanks,
"I love these earrings so much! They are so subtle but beautiful. Always get a compliment when i wear them. It was a little tricky getting them on at first, but you eventually get the hang of it. Would definitely recommend!",
"Love these! Exactly what I was looking for, perfect fit.",
"I do love the design, but with long hair sometimes I find my hair getting caught quite a bit and occasionally the back will curl out. But other then those minor things I love it.",
Der Versand nach Deutschland dauerte 2 1/2 Wochen. Umso gr√∂√üer war die Freude beim auspacken. Die Ohrringe passen sehr gut und piecksen auch beim liegen nicht unangenehm. Zu Weihnachten wird bestimmt noch das ein oder andere Paar verschenkt.,
Just got these and live them. Great quality and so pretty,
Simple but pretty! Love it!,
I love these so much!!! Simple yet beautiful,
"Took me a minute to figure out how to put them on, but once I did - really liked the way they look.  Unique and good quality too.",
"Loved these earrings! I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be one piece but it was a nice surprise as I tend to lose backs on ones that are separate! Also, they are solid silver which is nice for my extremely sensitive ears! Thank you for a beautiful product!",
I wasn't exactly sure what I had purchased when the earrings arrived but I have been wearing them ever since and I love them! I was able to put them on easier than I thought I would and I must say they are like wearing nothing - super light and comfortable. Nice craftsmanship - thank you!,
"These are cute, easy to put on, and virtually weightless. I love that they dont have a traditional earring back. It takes a second to figure out how to thread it onto your ear but once you get it it‚Äôs easy. They look great stacked with other earrings.",
"Beautiful, dainty and exceeded my expectations! üòÅ",
SO SO Great!  Love these earrings and i'll shop here again for sure.  Thank you.,

"Not quite as bright and shiney a silver it looks in photo, but nice design and happy with it overall",
I love these earrings - so simple yet very elegant and unique. I've received so many compliments- I wear them all the time!,
I love these. They're surprisingly easy to put in and I've already gotten a bunch of compliments on them.,

Simple and pretty! Happy to purchase from a creator.,
"Cute earrings! Item didn‚Äôt ship in promised timeline and seller was slow to respond to messages, but I‚Äôm still happy with the item",
I do like these earrings. I wasn't expecting the one-piece design (thought it was a front circle with post and a circle on the back fastener/jacket).  But the twist on design is easy to put on and I do like the look of these earrings when wearing them.  Glad I purchased.,
So understated and delicate but gorgeous!,
"I am new to discovering hypoallergenic jewelry. Like most with limited knowledge of hypoallergenic jewelry, I historically gave up on jewelry. I feel so lucky to have stumbled upon this seller! I purchased these earrings and I feel so grateful. Not only to do they not hurt my ears *at all* (which has never happened for me) they are backless earrings. They're light-weight, comfortable, and no tugs or pokes behind the ears from the back of the earring. I may never take these off!",
"This is a really lovely item. It was a little hard the first time I worn them, but then was easy after that. The earrings look great on.",

Beautiful!,

Simple and beautiful earrings. Love them.,
These were a lot smaller than I was expecting it they are really cute. Great quality.,
"Super cute earrings, but more importantly I was shocked by how comfortable they are, nothing pokes into your head like the backs of normal earrings. The only issue I have is that they can definitely fall out easily so be careful if you are for some reason moving around on a bed ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",
They are perfect. thank you!,

Very cute and simple. Love how they aren't super long and crawl up the whole ear. Thank you!,

"Really Cool earring. They look really nice in the right ear because the curve goes with the natural curve of your ear. My one complaint is that the left ear doesn't curve the right direction. Basically, you get two right ear, earrings. Still pretty though and I will still wear. But i wish the left fit like the right.

UPDATE: After posting this review, the seller kindly offered to send me a new pair of earrings as they should have been made one for each ear. Five stars for customer service!

"These earrings are cute, stylish and modern. I have really sensitive ears so I purchased the sterling silver pair hoping that they would not cause an irritation, but that was not the case. I‚Äôm not sure if these are sterling silver plated or pure sterling silver, but if you have sensitive ears they may not work for you.",
"My cousin absolutely loved these and wears them all the time, best birthday gift ever.",
"My cousin absolutely loved these and wears them all the time, best birthday gift ever.",
"I bought this to wear in my 3rd hole on one ear. It looks super cute, and is the right length to stay in place without disappearing all the way up my ear. My only issue is that it sometimes spins off of my ear when the back gets caught in my hair. I wish is didn't have the small bent part on the back.",
Cute earrings. Very small and dainty. I must have a larger ear lobe because they look much smaller on me.,
They arrived quickly and look just as pictured. Think my friend will be happy with her Christmas gift!,
Lovely little earrings. Thank you!,
"I love these earrings! I will say that shipping was exceptionally slow, with no tracking info shared, and the seller could have been more responsive. That said, the product was worth it!!

"They are beautiful... and were my new favorite earrings, but after only wearing them for a few days (never in my sleep) they are turning colors and one of my posts has already broken off.  Maybe I just have really bad luck, but I won't be spending 100 dollars on another pair.

Edit: Owner offered to fix the earring and is very responsive, thanks!",
"These earring are super duper rad and well made......buuuuut they turn my ears a color so I‚Äôm not quite sure the whole earring is sterling silver. In any case, this probably won‚Äôt deter me from by one of the other cool designs.",
"Grossi√®re 
Je vais changer la boucle d‚Äôoreille qui est trop grosse.",
"The earrings are beautiful.  The only reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 stars is that I had said I wanted my order cancelled if it wouldn't get here by Christmas.  It was a miracle that it did make it here on Christmas Eve, but I would have been extremely upset if it wasn't here by Christmas.  If you have a deadline for something I wouldn't order these unless you have well over a month for them to get to you.  They have to go through customs and there is not telling how long that will take.  But if you have time to get the jewelery then her stuff is absolutely beautiful and I would highly recommend it.",
"Really well made, substantial ear-rings. Will definitely shop with this seller again.",
"Lovely earrings, could have done with another hole option for the rear post though!",
"So beautiful, can‚Äôt wait to wear them!",
"After asking she could not supply tracking info. I did receive the earrings about 3 weeks later. I'm allergic to metals except for .925 Sterling Silver, and is how the earrings are described and the reason outside of loving the design I purchased them. After 2 days of wear, my ear lobes started to itch, swell and, the earrings discolored. I'm sorry I didn't request what other metals were used. My advice to the shop owner is please describe all metals used in jewelry, get shipping info for your customers, especially for international orders.",
These earrings are amazing! I didn't want anything too big just simple and dainty and these earrings are exactly that! So happy with my purchase and so happy with the quality. Thanks again!,
they are beautifull make a pretty christmasgift,

It has different holes so you can adjust depending on your lobe size. You just have to be careful when taking them off, because you have three separate pieces to keep track of (the front earring, the hanging earring, and the backing)!",

nAlso fast shipping. Great work! :)",
I am absolutely in love with these! They're exactly as I imagined. I would definitely buy from this seller again!,
"I love how the colour looks like in the product picture so I just choose the same colour ""Multicolor"". Now I quote the seller's words when he replied my question about ""Multicolor"": ""When I make a pair of pinwheel earrings in multicolor the color shades are blue - violet - gold at the bottom of the windmill and gold - teal on the top."" So the real products don't really have the same look as in the picture, but they are still beautiful, with ombre effect ;)",
These are beautiful! I got some for my bridesmaids to wear to my wedding and they loved them! I really liked the color options and the gift boxes and bags they came with :),
Amazing! Arrived in super timely manner. And they're gorgeous. Will definitely be looking at getting more colours! Love love love.,

i haven;t gotten them yet!,
"I don't know why I waited so long to purchase these. Seriously, they are the cutest little dainty ear jackets! Love the little spirals and curls, they are charming. Plus the phenomenal packaging - they come in a great little box, with anti tarnish strip, and the earrings are clipped onto a tree slice, words don't do it justice but it's fancy and perfect if you're wanting to gift these to someone very lucky! Photo doesn't do the box justice. I am pleased (very pleased!) with this purchase and highly recommend the seller.",
These earrings are absolutely beautiful! I am in love with them! I just received them yesterday and I have already gotten a couple compliments on them too! Amazing! :-),
I was so excited to get these earrings and I was right.  The quality and workmanship is beautiful.  So proud to wear these.  Thank you so much!,
These are so beautiful. I didn't realize how small they were (I didn't pay attention) but that doesn't for a second take away from loving them! Stunning!,
shipping was fast and spot on!  handcrafting is beautiful just love it.,
"This earrings couldn't be anymore awesome. They came nicely placed in a little wooden slice, with a piece of polishing cloth and an anti-tarnish paper. The work is delicate, excelent, and the overall look is super dainty and elegant. I love them, and I'm sure I will be back in the future, totally recommended shop!",
"These earrings are more beautiful than the picture shows! Love to wear them together or apart, I've chosen the small circle with the earcuff and it's gorgeous. I'll totally buy again from this shop :)",
These lovely tiny earrings arrived earlier than expected! What a joy! I love them! Very very fast delivery to germany! Thank you!,
"After a lot of shipping headaches, not due to Laura..I received my lovely jackets and just love them. Very nicely made and a good size. Highly recommend Laura‚Äôs beautiful creativity and workmanship!",
"Absolutely love this; beautiful, delicate, unique. Came in an exquisite package: mounted on a cross-section of wood, in a paper box with a handy silver polishing cloth. Looking forward to buying again soon!",
"Really Beautiful! Just as pictured and the packaging was a beautiful bonus. My ONLY disappointment is not quality or service related and can't remedied without custom work, but I want to mention it so you are aware. When wearing these earrings as pictured here, the back piece hangs down more than I'd like it to on MY ears. This is due to the position of the hole in my ear and consequently a narrow lobe. However, this may not be the case for your ears. I was just hoping the back piece would 'cup' my ear, not hang down so low. I still love them and wear them the other way! They were worth the wait and actually arrived sooner than I expected, considering where they came from (I'm in the US). So, still an all around 5 Stars.",
So beautiful! Love them,
"Mix and match with my stud earrings. Well worth it, and just really beautifully made.",
Love love love these earrings,
Love these earrings.  Fit beautifully with diamond studs.  Great for everyday and evening.  Comfortable enough to wear for days on end.,

The earrings are really well done and simply beautiful!
Wow packaging!!!!!! 
Thank u so much!",
"I really love these. As far as earring jackets go they are pretty unique in design/pattern and I really like that. Honestly,  I find them a little pricey compared to what I am used to paying in the U.S. even from handmade artisans, but not a ton, and their uniqueness was enough to make me want to buy them anyway. Quality was great. If the prices went down a little I'd probably buy a lot more but can't say I would at this time priced as they were when I bought them.",
"What we got was exactly as described on line. My wife was very pleased with the gift. The process of ordering and receiving the jacket earrings was straightforward and easy.
If my wife drops additional hints for CookOnStrike, I'm sure I'll follow through.",
These earrings are very well made - better than what you find in the stores these days. Laura takes a lot of care packaging them and even including a cleaning cloth. Thank you Laura!,

I may try the sunburst jackets next sold by the owner. Shipping was fantastic and the owner is absolutely great. Will purchase from this store again!",
Love them!,
"Once again, this shop doesn't disappoint! My second pair of jackets and have another pair of studs to mix it up. Love the ear jackets, so cute and fun!",
"I cannot say enough good things about this purchase! Catie was super helpful with all of my questions. She didn't bat an eyelash (at me anyway) when I accidentally listed the wrong shipping address and the first set of earrings had to be returned to sender. And my earrings came today and I love them SO much, I know they'll be my go-tos. Have already picked my next set of jackets.",

"Look even better than the picture! Very cool. 

Delivery fast and seller was easy to work with.",

"I love these earrings!!!!  At first they didn't stay in a climbing position but that's because I got the 7 stone climbers and my upper ears are both thin and narrow. I have issues with all climbers because of my ears. I worked with the store and she was amazing to work with. Margay walked me through how to adjust them and they work!!! They stay in a climbing position! I love these earrings, great quality, super great customer service and fast shipping. Will be purchasing from this shop again for certain.",
"Love love love my custom ear climbers! Super helpful shop. Wonderful customer service, and beautiful product. Many thanks!",
I am obsessed with these!! Thank you SO much! üí´üí´üí´,

I will definitely buy more items from this shop because they obviously care about the happiness of their customers. Thank you so much for being so awesome!!!!!",

Obsessed with these.,
"The rose gold ear climbers are a beautiful color just as I hoped.  They stay in place quite well.  Sometimes my hair catches them but that's the life with a lot of crazy waves.  They go up almost half way up my ear, were easy to put in and they are classy and funky with out being ""too much"" to wear to an office, interview, etc.  They arrived quickly and were packaged nicely.  I would purchase from Glamrock again.",
"I love these so much. I get compliments constantly. And my first pair, in rose gold which I still have, have held up for years while often being thrown in my purse. They haven't bent or broken. Loved them so much, had to get a gold pair too.",
These earrings are gorgeous!  I get constant compliments on them.  They require a little fiddling and squeezing to get them to stay in place.,

The design of this necklace is simple but so stylish. I like it so much. It also looks so sophisticated that I often enjoy wearing it. It matches with various type of clothes. Thanks a lot.,

The ear climber cuff/clip has this thing in the back to help tighten it to the desired fit which is awesome. It also came with a Swarovski Crystal ID number which was super nice. Do not hesitate to buy!! If I could put pictures of both earrings on I would but I only seem to be able to upload one so the picture is of the rose gold ear climber!!,
"One of the jewel‚Äôs prongs weren‚Äôt closed, so that one got loose and I had to fix it. Definitely love my earrings though!!! They are perfect for my big day.",
Beautiful,
These earrings are incredibly beautiful and unique and will be perfect for my wedding day. They also arrived very quickly and in lovely packaging. Very glad to have found this shop!,
The earrings are absolutely beautiful !! They look exactly like the pictures and I can‚Äôt wait to wear them on my wedding day.,
gorgeous! looks great as a pair (one on each ear) and looks great with the crawler on one ear depending on the hairdo- very very happy with the purchase of both!!!!!!!,
"These are so cool looking, I can‚Äôt wait to wear them!! They are a little on the heavy side so I probably will wear them only for the reception (not the ceremony) but they are going to look SO GOOD with my leather jacket! Just an FYI these are glamorous enough that you probably don‚Äôt need a necklace with them!",
gorgeous!! stones were gorgeous and workmanship was well done!,
Beautiful pair of earrings! I love it! Arrived quickly and safely. Thanks for a smooth transaction. :),
Item came as expected in regards to quality. Shipped in a timely manner. Aesthetically pleasing. Will give updates on day of wear on wedding date.,
Just what I wanted for my wedding day. Thank you,

"The earrings are lovely to look at, and look great on. But they hurt every time I wear them no matter how long or how often they always cause me pain....to the point I have to take them off....it makes me sad because they are seriously cute, hopefully it‚Äôs just me and the shape of my ears???",
Beautiful work of art. She loves them!,
They are easy to insert and they look really nice on! They don't slide off and are comfortable to wear - aI actually forgot I was wearing them at one point:),

Lovely thank you,
Very happy with my earrings.  No adverse reaction to the metal.  Shipped on time.  All's good ;-),
"I love the earings as they look modern and very pretty. BUT they fall out very quickly and can get lost. I know I lost one in the hospital.
The staff all felll in love with the remaining one and I am hoping the lost one will be returned.",
"It got shipped out WAY sooner than promised - a nice surprise! They feel very delicate, I had thought I might wear these quite often (they are very beautiful but I *think* understated enough to do so), but I am afraid of breaking them. One fits my ear better than the other but the directions were very clear and I don‚Äôt think it will be a problem (must be something with me, I imagine, as all bodies are different). Overall very impressed",
beautiful! Just right for the wedding outfit that I wore.,
So beautiful - tons of compliments! Easy to wear and stay put.,
I chose these earrings for my wedding. So beautiful.,
Simply beautiful ! Thanks a lot.,
Honestly really obsessed with these earrings. I was worried they wouldn‚Äôt stay in place or they would be uncomfortable but I was wrong on both accounts. I have pretty sensitive ears and I haven‚Äôt noticed any issues with that either. These are really pretty and I would highly recommend them.,
My daughter wore these on her wedding day and they were stunning! You won‚Äôt be disappointed!,
"These are really beautiful - am planning on wearing for my wedding.  Everything arrived quickly and came with instructions.  They are lightweight without feeling cheap, so I will be able to wear them for the whole day.",

Really flattering to the ear and staying subtle,
Cute earrings! They shipped very quickly too!,
"Very pretty, as pictured. The only thing is they do not come with backs, just a hook like some dangly earrings have. So you kind of have to squeeze that part behind your ear lobe to make sure they are on tight. I will try to see if I can put on my own backs to see if that helps but I wish they came more secure.",
Great pair of earrings and excellent communication and shipping! Thanks!,
The ear climbers are lovely and were as described.  I appreciate the timely information that was provided by the seller and would definitely purchase more items from them.,

Much smaller than photo. Read the description for accurate size. I didn't bother to read that because I assumed it would look like the photo.,
"I've wanted to try an ear climber for a while, but wasn't really sure how they would look on me.  I decided on this gorgeous design and I'm so glad I did.  I love them (I ordered the pair).  They are fantastic...don't hesitate if you're thinking about these!",

This is such a lovely design. Very well made indeed and it is clear a lot of love and care went into it. My ears I have discovered are much smaller than I thought- the wave sits in the groove but it is so close the the edge of my ear haha,

"I'm loving these climbers....these are my first of this style so there was a learning curve to figure out how to get them in easily, but now it's a piece of cake. Love the minimalist design & hammered texture. They're perfect!",
"Pros:   Minimalistic. Super pretty. Everybody compliments them. I can sleep and shower and do everything with them. My hair hasn't gotten stuck in them yet. All-around superb purchase. 

 Cons:  really hard for me to put in my ears. Mostly because I think one of my holes is a little crooked.  I won't be taking them out anytime soon, and it's already been a few weeks, so it doesn't matter too much.",
"A little difficult to put on at first but worth it! very delicate and minimal, I love them!",
"Absolutely love these earrings! They were a little tricky to get on the first time, since I haven't had a style like this before.  But they fit nicely, and were exactly what I wanted - something minimal but a little trendy.  I'm not one for big earrings and these are perfect!",
I seriously love them.  I pretty much haven't taken them out since I got them and find sleeping in them to be comfortable.  I did have to pull them apart a tiny bit just because they were hurting my ears but now they fit awesome.  But I love them!!!!,
Love these so much for my girls!! They‚Äôre perfect!!,
Absolutely beautiful! Stays in place (and one of my earlobes used to be gauged!) and shines nicely.,

These are my Go-To earrings.  I answer the phone all day and some earring can get annoying or in the way.  It's a small thing but when it happens all day long it can get frustrating.  I don't have a problem with these.  They are beautiful and easy to wear.,

"The customer service was fast and lovely. The package came with a handwritten note and a cute lollipop ü•∞, thanks! The earcuffs are very nice - they are easy to put on, they don't pinch the ear and they fit snugly, and most of all - are as pretty as they were on the pictures provided by KivotosJewelry. 10/10 would buy again üòÅ",
Item is just as pictured! Just lovely. I did the free shipping to the US so it took awhile but I was offered faster shipping but would have to pay. So I decided to wait. Earrings are delicate and slightly smaller than I wanted but still wonderful! Would buy again.,
Absolutely stunning ring! The blue stone has gold highlights that pair perfectly with the gold band. The band itself feels solid and well-made. The seller was very easy to work with and promptly responded to messages about customization.,
"I LOVE this ring. It‚Äôs so beautiful! It has a nice shimmer indoors, but under the lights and sun it sparkles ‚ú® it took 3 months to get here because of covid and the fact that for me it was international shipping. After not having it weeks after the supposed arrival date I emailed them to see if they had any info on their side. They contacted the post office and responded to me very quickly about what was going on. (The item was already in my country just not scanned in yet). I was sad, but the wait was worth it for me. I love it so much. THANK YOU!!!
It also came BEAUTIFULLY packaged in a cute suede pouch covered in green tissue w/ a painted wood ladybug sticker. Also received a dried flower and sticker logo. Husband & I are big travelers and will probably frame the flower üíú",
Bought the ear crawlers together with a tiny single flower earring to wear on the other ear and I couldn't be happier. They fit perfectly and are as pretty as on the pictures. Also great communication and customer care from Eleni and her team. Thank you!,

The Kivotos Jewelry staff answered my email questions promptly and knowledgeably. They packed the earrings so they would not break in transit and shipped them soon after they were  ready to go.

"I ordered these earrings in black and another pair, back in November.  After several weeks of non-shipment, I had to reach out to the seller to check on my purchase.  Instead of shipping black, she shipped yellow (the description on my order even says black).  I pointed this out and she said she would send a black pair the next day.  After reaching out once again at the end of December, she has not provided a tracking number and the black earrings have not arrived.  Although the customer service has not been good, both pairs of earrings I ordered are of good quality.",

unique, yet classically beautiful to wear for my wedding day and I think I found them!",
"I like these earrings, but the posts are rough, not entirely smooth, and the unevenness is felt as soon as they go on. I really like the design and look of the spikes, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting a lack of quality, especially for the price paid, and also for the quality promise that the store offers for all their pieces.

Magnifiques boucles d oreilles de tr√®s belle qualit√© et une livraison rapide. Merci pour votre cr√©ation.,
"jolies boucles, et livraison dans les temps service s√©rieux malgr√© mon appr√©hension du fait de la distance.",
"Item arrived damaged. Seller ignored my first couple e-mails until I opened a case, even though when I had questions prior to purchasing, she responded very quickly. Seller told me to fix the crooked and bent posts myself with pliers. Seller still wanted me to reimburse her $15 dollars for her shipping costs along with incurring my own shipping costs (roughly $30 USD) to send the earrings back. If I am paying over $100 for earrings, I shouldn‚Äôt have to fix the poor workmanship myself with pliers. Horrible customer service, non responsive and does not have any pride in her product. Very disappointed, if I could give her less than 1 star, I would.",
"Gorgeous and quality, but very lightweight. They don't tangle in curvy hair and it's nearly impossible to feel them when they're in. Amazing!",
Wundersch√∂n! Bin total verliebt! üòç War bestimmt nicht meine letzte Bestellung. Alles super gelaufen und schnelle Lieferung! Das war 100% nicht die einzige Bestellung.,
"These are beautiful. I love jewelry that is just a little different so these fish are great. The one gold one in with all the silver, so unique. Worth the wait (about a month) to get them from Germany",
"It took quite some time for these to arrive because of COVID-related shipping restrictions (NOT the fault of the seller!) but when they did they were absolutely adorable! Excellent quality, fit beautifully, very comfortable, and even more charming in person than in the photos. I‚Äôve already received multiple compliments.",
Shipping was delayed due to Covid and the seller went above and beyond to let me know. Jewelry looks a little smaller in person but is delicate and dainty. I get so many compliments when I wear them.,
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE these rings!!!  It couldn‚Äôt have fit my existing ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù wedding band set anymore perfect!!!  I also received earrings which are adorable as well!!!  I may have to add to my collection now!  Thank you!!!!,

These arrived sooner than the items I ordered the same day from sellers here in the states.  I will definitely buy from this seller again!!",

"These fish earrings are not only adorable, but such good quality! Shipping has been so slow due to COVID-19, but the shop kept reassuring me the earrings were on their way! They even added a cute necklace (free of charge) as a thank you for waiting :)",
Sehr sch√∂n verarbeitet; waren sehr gut verpackt; es war ein Geburtstagsgeschenk f√ºr eine Freundin und sie hat sich riesig gefreut dar√ºber; die Idee - das ein Fisch gegen den Strom schwimmt ist einfach toll und witzig,
FABELHAFT ! ICH TRAGE ES SEHR GERN !,
"J‚Äôaime bien ces boucles d‚Äôoreilles, elles sont petites /fines; sur la photo je m‚Äô√©tais fait l‚Äôid√©e qu‚Äôelles √©taient plus grandes mais finalement je suis contente de la taille. Le seul b√©mol c‚Äôest qu‚Äôelles bougent beaucoup m√™me si j‚Äôai r√©serr√© la partie derri√®re l‚Äôoreille. Dommage parce que elles ne restent pas en place et √ßa me g√™ne. Je ne sais pas si c‚Äôest la forme de mes oreilles ou la conception de la partie arri√®re des boucles...",
